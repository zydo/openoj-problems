# Find the Maximum Factor Score of Array

## Description

You are given an integer array nums.

The factor score of an array is defined as the product of the LCM and GCD
of all elements of that array.

Return the maximum factor score of nums after removing at most one element
from it.

Note that both the LCM and GCD of a single number are the number itself,
and the factor score of an empty array is 0.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [2,4,8,16]
Output: 64
Explanation: On removing 2, the GCD of the rest of the elements is 4 while
the LCM is 16, which gives a maximum factor score of 4 * 16 = 64.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 60
Explanation: The maximum factor score of 60 can be obtained without
removing any elements.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [3]
Output: 9
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use brute force approach with two loops.

### Hint 2

Optimize using prefix and suffix arrays.
