# Minimum Total Operations

## Description

Given an array of integers `nums`, you can perform any number of operations
on this array.

In each operation, you can:

- Choose a prefix of the array.
- Choose an integer k (which can be negative) and add k to each element in
  the chosen prefix.

A prefix of an array is a subarray that starts from the beginning of the
array and extends to any point within it.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in
arr equal.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,4,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Operation 1: Choose the prefix [1, 4] of length 2 and add -2
to each element of the prefix. The array becomes [-1, 2, 2]. Operation 2:
Choose the prefix [-1] of length 1 and add 3 to it. The array becomes
[2, 2, 2]. Thus, the minimum number of required operations is 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [10,10,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: All elements are already equal, so no operations are needed.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Would you ever change the last element of the array?
