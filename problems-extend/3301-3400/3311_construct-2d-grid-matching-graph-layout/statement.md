# Construct 2D Grid Matching Graph Layout

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` representing an undirected graph having `n` nodes, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

Construct a 2D grid that satisfies these conditions:

- The grid contains all nodes from `0` to `n - 1` in its cells, with each node appearing exactly once.
- Two nodes should be in adjacent grid cells (horizontally or vertically) if and only if there is an edge between them in `edges`.

It is guaranteed that `edges` can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.

Return a 2D integer array satisfying the conditions above. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [[3,1],[2,0]]
Explanation: The grid is:
3 1
2 0
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]]
Output: [[4,2,3,1,0]]
Explanation: The grid is:
4 2 3 1 0
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: n = 9, edges = [[0,1],[0,4],[0,5],[1,7],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6],[4,6],[4,7],[6,8],[7,8]]
Output: [[8,6,3],[7,4,2],[1,0,5]]
Explanation: The grid is:
8 6 3
7 4 2
1 0 5
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= edges.length <= 10⁵`
- `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`
- `0 <= ui < vi < n`
- All the edges are distinct.
- The input is generated such that edges can form a 2D grid that satisfies the conditions.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Observe the indegrees of the nodes.

### Hint 2

The case where there are two nodes with an indegree of 1, and all the others have an indegree of 2 can be handled separately.

### Hint 3

The nodes with the smallest degrees are the corners.

### Hint 4

You can simulate the grid creation process using BFS or a similar approach after making some observations on the indegrees.
