# Users With Two Purchases Within Seven Days

## Description

Table: `Purchases`

| Column Name  | Type |
| ------------ | ---- |
| purchase_id  | int  |
| user_id      | int  |
| purchase_date| date |

purchase_id contains unique values.
This table contains logs of the dates that users purchased from a certain
retailer.

Write a solution to report the IDs of the users that made any two purchases
at most 7 days apart.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

Each testcase's `dataset` seeds the `Purchases` table: its script inserts
the testcase's `Purchases` rows before your query runs.

The result format is in the following example.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
Purchases table:
+-------------+---------+---------------+
| purchase_id | user_id | purchase_date |
+-------------+---------+---------------+
| 4           | 2       | 2022-03-13    |
| 1           | 5       | 2022-02-11    |
| 3           | 7       | 2022-06-19    |
| 6           | 2       | 2022-03-20    |
| 5           | 7       | 2022-06-19    |
| 2           | 2       | 2022-06-08    |
+-------------+---------+---------------+
Output:
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 2       |
| 7       |
+---------+
Explanation:
User 2 had two purchases on 2022-03-13 and 2022-03-20. Since the second purchase is within 7 days of the first purchase, we add their ID.
User 5 had only 1 purchase.
User 7 had two purchases on the same day so we add their ID.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning one column named
`user_id`, ordered by `user_id`.
