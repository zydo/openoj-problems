# Find the Number of Ways to Place People I

## Description

You are given a 2D array `points` of size `n x 2` representing integer
coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

Count the number of pairs of points `(A, B)`, where

- `A` is on the upper left side of `B`, and
- there are no other points in the rectangle (or line) they make
  (including the border), except for the points `A` and `B`.

Return the count.

### Example 1

```text
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to choose A and B such that A is on the
upper left side of B.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: points = [[6,2],[4,4],[2,6]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- The left one is the pair (points[1], points[0]), where points[1] is on
  the upper left side of points[0] and the rectangle is empty.
- The middle one is the pair (points[2], points[1]), same as the left one
  it is a valid pair.
- The right one is the pair (points[2], points[0]), where points[2] is on
  the upper left side of points[0], but points[1] is inside the rectangle
  so it's not a valid pair.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: points = [[3,1],[1,3],[1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- The left one is the pair (points[2], points[0]), where points[2] is on
  the upper left side of points[0] and there are no other points on the
  line they form. Note that it is a valid state when the two points form
  a line.
- The middle one is the pair (points[1], points[2]), it is a valid pair
  same as the left one.
- The right one is the pair (points[1], points[0]), it is not a valid
  pair as points[2] is on the border of the rectangle.
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 50`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 50`
- All `points[i]` are distinct.

## Hints

### Hint 1

We can enumerate all the upper-left and lower-right corners.

### Hint 2

If the upper-left corner is `(x1, y1)` and lower-right corner is `(x2,
y2)`, check that there is no point `(x, y)` such that `x1 <= x <= x2` and
`y2 <= y <= y1`.
