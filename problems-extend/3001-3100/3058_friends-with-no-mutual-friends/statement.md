# Friends With No Mutual Friends

## Description

Table: `Friends`

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| user_id1    | int  |
| user_id2    | int  |

`(user_id1, user_id2)` is the primary key (combination of columns with
unique values) for this table.
Each row contains user id1, user id2, both of whom are friends with each
other.

Write a solution to find all pairs of users who are friends with each
other and have no mutual friends.

Return the result table ordered by `user_id1`, `user_id2` in ascending
order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Friends`
table with that testcase's rows. The result format is in the following
example.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
Friends table:
+----------+----------+
| user_id1 | user_id2 |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 1        | 5        |
| 6        | 7        |
| 3        | 4        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 8        | 9        |
+----------+----------+
Output:
+----------+----------+
| user_id1 | user_id2 |
+----------+----------+
| 6        | 7        |
| 8        | 9        |
+----------+----------+
Explanation:
- Users 1 and 2 are friends with each other, but they share a mutual friend with user ID 5, so this pair is not included.
- Users 2 and 3 are friends, they both share a mutual friend with user ID 4, resulting in exclusion, similarly for users 2 and 4 who share a mutual friend with user ID 3, hence not included.
- Users 1 and 5 are friends with each other, but they share a mutual friend with user ID 2, so this pair is not included.
- Users 6 and 7, as well as users 8 and 9, are friends with each other, and they don't have any mutual friends, hence included.
- Users 3 and 4 are friends with each other, but their mutual connection with user ID 2 means they are not included, similarly for users 2 and 5 are friends but are excluded due to their mutual connection with user ID 1.
Output table is ordered by user_id1 in ascending order.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning two columns —
`user_id1`, `user_id2` — with one row for every stored friendship whose
two users have no mutual friend, reported in the column order its row
stores. A friendship holds whichever column lists which id, so treat the
table as an undirected graph: a mutual friend of a stored pair is a third
user, different from both members, who appears together with each of
them in some row — in either column order.
