# Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game

## Description

Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a field, with two lanes of
flowers between them. There are x flowers in the first lane between Alice and
Bob, and y flowers in the second lane between them.

The game proceeds as follows:

- Alice takes the first turn.
- In each turn, a player must choose either one of the lane and pick one flower from that side.
- At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all in either lane, the current player captures their opponent and wins the game.

Given two integers, n and m, the task is to compute the number of possible
pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions:

- Alice must win the game according to the described rules.
- The number of flowers x in the first lane must be in the range [1,n].
- The number of flowers y in the second lane must be in the range [1,m].

Return the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions
mentioned in the statement.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 3, m = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The following pairs satisfy conditions described in the statement: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1).
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 1, m = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: No pairs satisfy the conditions described in the statement.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n, m <= 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

(x, y) is valid if and only if they have different parities.
