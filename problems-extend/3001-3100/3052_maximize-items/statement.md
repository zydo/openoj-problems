# Maximize Items

## Description

Table: `Inventory`

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| item_id | int |
| item_type | varchar |
| item_category | varchar |
| square_footage | decimal |

`item_id` is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row includes item id, item type, item category and square footage.

A warehouse wants to maximize the number of items it can stock in a
500,000 square feet warehouse. It wants to stock as many prime items as
possible, and afterwards use the remaining square footage to stock the
most number of non-prime items.

Write a solution to find the number of prime and non-prime items that can
be stored in the 500,000 square feet warehouse. Output the item type with
`prime_eligible` followed by `not_prime` and the maximum number of items
that can be stocked.

Note:

- Item count must be a whole number (integer).
- If the count for the `not_prime` category is 0, you should output 0 for
  that particular category.

Return the result table ordered by item count in descending order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`, whose statements insert all rows
into `Inventory` before your query runs. The result format is shown in the
following example.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
Inventory table:
item_id  item_type       item_category  square_footage
1374     prime_eligible  Watches        68.00
4245     not_prime       Art            26.40
5743     prime_eligible  Software       325.00
8543     not_prime       Clothing       64.50
2556     not_prime       Shoes          15.00
2452     prime_eligible  Scientific     85.00
3255     not_prime       Furniture      22.60
1672     prime_eligible  Beauty         8.50
4256     prime_eligible  Furniture      55.50
6325     prime_eligible  Food           13.20
Output:
item_type      item_count
prime_eligible 5400
not_prime      8
Explanation: the prime-eligible category comprises a total of 6 items,
amounting to a combined square footage of 555.20 (68 + 325 + 85 + 8.50 +
55.50 + 13.20). It is possible to store 900 combinations of these 6 items,
totaling 5400 items and occupying 499,680 square footage. In the not_prime
category, there are a total of 4 items with a combined square footage of
128.50. After deducting the storage used by prime-eligible items
(500,000 - 499,680 = 320), there is room for 2 combinations of non-prime
items, accommodating a total of 8 non-prime items within the available
320 square footage. Output table is ordered by item count in descending
order.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning two columns —
`item_type` and `item_count` — with one row for each item type, counting
whole combinations only and reporting 0 for a type that ends up with no
room or no rows.
