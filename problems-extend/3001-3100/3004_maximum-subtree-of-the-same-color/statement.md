# Maximum Subtree of the Same Color

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array edges representing a tree with n nodes,
numbered from 0 to n - 1, rooted at node 0, where edges[i] = [ui, vi]
means there is an edge between the nodes vi and ui.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array colors of size n, where
colors[i] is the color assigned to node i.

We want to find a node v such that every node in the subtree of v has the
same color.

Return the size of such subtree with the maximum number of nodes possible.

### Example 1

```text
Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], colors = [1,1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Each color is represented as: 1 -> Red, 2 -> Green,
3 -> Blue. We can see that the subtree rooted at node 0 has children with
different colors. Any other subtree is of the same color and has a size
of 1. Hence, we return 1.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], colors = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: The whole tree has the same color, and the subtree rooted at
node 0 has the most number of nodes which is 4. Hence, we return 4.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]], colors = [1,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Each color is represented as: 1 -> Red, 2 -> Green,
3 -> Blue. We can see that the subtree rooted at node 0 has children with
different colors. Any other subtree is of the same color, but the subtree
rooted at node 2 has a size of 3 which is the maximum. Hence, we return 3.
```

### Constraints

- `n == edges.length + 1`
- `1 <= n <= 5 × 10⁴`
- `edges[i] == [ui, vi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi < n`
- `colors.length == n`
- `1 <= colors[i] <= 10⁵`
- The input is generated such that the graph represented by edges is a
  tree.

## Hints

### Hint 1

For each node, define a flag[v] indicating that the subtree of this node
contains only one color or not.

### Hint 2

In the DFS process, when you call dfs(u) from node v, after that DFS of u
has finished, check if flag[u] == false, then flag[v] is also false.

### Hint 3

Also if color[v] != color[u], flag[v] becomes false.
