# Find the Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles

## Description

There exist `n` rectangles in a 2D plane with edges parallel to the x and y
axis. You are given two 2D integer arrays `bottomLeft` and `topRight` where
`bottomLeft[i] = [a_i, b_i]` and `topRight[i] = [c_i, d_i]` represent the
bottom-left and top-right coordinates of the `ith` rectangle, respectively.

You need to find the maximum area of a square that can fit inside the
intersecting region of at least two rectangles. Return 0 if such a square
does not exist.

### Example 1

```text
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,1]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[6,6]]
Output: 1
Explanation: A square with side length 1 can fit inside either the
intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of
rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 1. It can be shown that a
square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region
of two rectangles.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[1,3],[1,5]], topRight = [[5,5],[5,7],[5,9]]
Output: 4
Explanation: A square with side length 2 can fit inside either the
intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of
rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 2 * 2 = 4. It can be shown
that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting
region of two rectangles.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[3,4]]
Output: 1
Explanation: A square with side length 1 can fit inside the intersecting
region of any two rectangles. Also, no larger square can, so the maximum
area is 1. Note that the region can be formed by the intersection of more
than 2 rectangles.
```

### Example 4

```text
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[3,3],[3,1]], topRight = [[2,2],[4,4],[4,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No pair of rectangles intersect, hence, the answer is 0.
```

### Constraints

- `n == bottomLeft.length == topRight.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10³`
- `bottomLeft[i].length == topRight[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= bottomLeft[i][0], bottomLeft[i][1] <= 10⁷`
- `1 <= topRight[i][0], topRight[i][1] <= 10⁷`
- `bottomLeft[i][0] < topRight[i][0]`
- `bottomLeft[i][1] < topRight[i][1]`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Brute Force the intersection area of each pair of rectangles.

### Hint 2

Two rectangles will not overlap when the bottom left x coordinate of one
rectangle is greater than the top right x coordinate of the other rectangle.
The same is true for the y coordinate.

### Hint 3

The intersection area (if any) is also a rectangle. Find its corners.
