# Path Sum IV

## Description

If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by
an array of three-digit integers. You are given an ascending array `nums`
consisting of three-digit integers representing a binary tree with a depth
smaller than 5, where for each integer:

- The hundreds digit represents the depth `d` of this node, where `1 <= d <= 4`.
- The tens digit represents the position `p` of this node within its level,
  where `1 <= p <= 8`, corresponding to its position in a full binary tree.
- The units digit represents the value `v` of this node, where `0 <= v <= 9`.

Return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

It is guaranteed that the given array represents a valid connected binary tree.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [113,215,221]
Output: 12
Explanation: The tree that the list represents is shown.
The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [113,221]
Output: 4
Explanation: The tree that the list represents is shown.
The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 15`
- `110 <= nums[i] <= 489`
- `nums` represents a valid binary tree with depth less than 5.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
