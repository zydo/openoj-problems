        # membership: keep every value already visited in a hash set, and
        # each new node learns with one lookup whether its partner came
        # earlier. The lookup comes before the insert — the ordering that
        # forbids a node pairing with itself, so a k equal to twice a
        # value that occurs once stays false. The visiting order is
        # irrelevant: any traversal that reaches every node sees one
        # member of a summing pair before the other, so a plain preorder
        # returns true at the first hit and false only after the whole
        # tree is exhausted. The walk carries its own stack of nodes: the
        # tree may be a single 10^4-node chain, whose walk would nest
        # 10000 calls — past CPython's default recursion limit and over
        # the 512k stacks the judge hands Java and Node — so every
        # runtime iterates instead.
