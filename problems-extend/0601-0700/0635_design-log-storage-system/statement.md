# Design Log Storage System

## Description

You are given several logs, where each log contains a unique ID and timestamp.
Timestamp is a string that has the following format:
Year:Month:Day:Hour:Minute:Second, for example, `2017:01:01:23:59:59`. All
domains are zero-padded decimal numbers.

Implement the LogSystem class:

- `LogSystem()` Initializes the LogSystem object.
- `void put(int id, string timestamp)` Stores the given log (id, timestamp) in
  your storage system.
- `int[] retrieve(string start, string end, string granularity)` Returns the
  IDs of the logs whose timestamps are within the range from `start` to `end`
  inclusive. `start` and `end` all have the same format as `timestamp`, and
  `granularity` means how precise the range should be (i.e. to the exact Day,
  Minute, etc.). For example, `start = "2017:01:01:23:59:59"`,
  `end = "2017:01:02:23:59:59"`, and `granularity = "Day"` means that we need
  to find the logs within the inclusive range from Jan. 1st 2017 to Jan. 2nd
  2017, and the Hour, Minute, and Second for each log entry can be ignored.
  The IDs are returned in the order their logs were stored.

### Example 1

```text
Input
["LogSystem", "put", "put", "put", "retrieve", "retrieve"]
[[], [1, "2017:01:01:23:59:59"], [2, "2017:01:01:22:59:59"], [3, "2016:01:01:00:00:00"], ["2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Year"], ["2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Hour"]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2]]
Explanation
LogSystem logSystem = new LogSystem();
logSystem.put(1, "2017:01:01:23:59:59");
logSystem.put(2, "2017:01:01:22:59:59");
logSystem.put(3, "2016:01:01:00:00:00");

// return [1, 2, 3], because you need to return all logs between 2016 and 2017.
logSystem.retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Year");

// return [1, 2], because you need to return all logs between Jan. 1, 2016 01:XX:XX and Jan. 1, 2017 23:XX:XX.
// Log 3 is not returned because Jan. 1, 2016 00:00:00 comes before the start of the range.
logSystem.retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01", "2017:01:01:23:00:00", "Hour");
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= id <= 500`
- `2000 <= Year <= 2017`
- `1 <= Month <= 12`
- `1 <= Day <= 31`
- `0 <= Hour <= 23`
- `0 <= Minute, Second <= 59`
- `granularity` is one of the values `["Year", "Month", "Day", "Hour", "Minute", "Second"]`.
- At most `500` calls will be made to `put` and `retrieve`.
