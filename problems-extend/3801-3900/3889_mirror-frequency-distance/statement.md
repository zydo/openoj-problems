# Mirror Frequency Distance

## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and
digits.

For each character, its mirror character is defined by reversing the order
of its character set:

- For letters, the mirror of a character is the letter at the same position
  from the end of the alphabet.

    For example, the mirror of `'a'` is `'z'`, and the mirror of `'b'` is
    `'y'`, and so on.

- For digits, the mirror of a character is the digit at the same position
  from the end of the range `'0'` to `'9'`.

    For example, the mirror of `'0'` is `'9'`, and the mirror of `'1'` is
    `'8'`, and so on.

For each unique character `c` in the string:

- Let `m` be its mirror character.
- Let `freq(x)` denote the number of times character `x` appears in the
  string.
- Compute the absolute difference between their frequencies, defined as:
  `|freq(c) - freq(m)|`.

The mirror pairs `(c, m)` and `(m, c)` are the same and must be counted only
once.

Return an integer denoting the total sum of these values over all such
distinct mirror pairs.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "ab1z9"
Output: 3
Explanation:
    For every mirror pair:

        c   m   freq(c)  freq(m)  |freq(c) - freq(m)|
        a   z   1        1        0
        b   y   1        0        1
        1   8   1        0        1
        9   0   1        0        1

    Thus, the answer is 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "4m7n"
Output: 2
Explanation:
    For every mirror pair:

        c   m   freq(c)  freq(m)  |freq(c) - freq(m)|
        4   5   1        0        1
        m   n   1        1        0
        7   2   1        0        1

    Thus, the answer is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: s = "byby"
Output: 0
Explanation:
    For every mirror pair:

        c   m   freq(c)  freq(m)  |freq(c) - freq(m)|
        b   y   2        2        0

    Thus, the answer is 0.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10⁵`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Simulate as described using two pointers.
