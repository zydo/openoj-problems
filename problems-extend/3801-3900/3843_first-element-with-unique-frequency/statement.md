# First Element with Unique Frequency

## Description

You are given an integer array nums.

Return an integer denoting the first element (scanning from left to right)
in nums whose frequency is unique. That is, no other integer appears the same
number of times in nums. If there is no such element, return -1.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [20,10,30,30]
Output: 30
Explanation:
    20 appears once.
    10 appears once.
    30 appears twice.
    The frequency of 30 is unique because no other integer appears exactly
    twice.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [20,20,10,30,30,30]
Output: 20
Explanation:
    20 appears twice.
    10 appears once.
    30 appears 3 times.
    The frequency of 20, 10, and 30 are unique. The first element that has
    unique frequency is 20.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [10,10,20,20]
Output: -1
Explanation:
    10 appears twice.
    20 appears twice.
    No element has a unique frequency.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use two hash maps: one freq and one freqCount

### Hint 2

First pass: for each x in nums do freq[x] += 1

### Hint 3

Build counts of frequencies: for each f in values of freq do freqCount[f] += 1

### Hint 4

Scan nums from left to right and return the first x with freqCount[freq[x]]
== 1; return -1 if none
