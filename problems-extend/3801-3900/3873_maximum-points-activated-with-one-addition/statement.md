# Maximum Points Activated with One Addition

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi]
represents the coordinates of the ith point. All coordinates in points are
distinct.

If a point is activated, then all points that have the same x-coordinate or
y-coordinate become activated as well.

Activation continues until no additional points can be activated.

You may add one additional point at any integer coordinate (x, y) not
already present in points. Activation begins by activating this newly added
point.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of points that can be
activated, including the newly added point.

### Example 1

```text
Input: points = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Adding and activating a point such as (1, 3) causes
activations:
- (1, 3) shares x = 1 with (1, 1) and (1, 2) -> (1, 1) and (1, 2) become
  activated.
- (1, 2) shares y = 2 with (2, 2) -> (2, 2) becomes activated.
Thus, the activated points are (1, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), so 4 points
in total. We can show this is the maximum activated.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: points = [[2,2],[1,1],[3,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Adding and activating a point such as (1, 2) causes
activations:
- (1, 2) shares x = 1 with (1, 1) -> (1, 1) becomes activated.
- (1, 2) shares y = 2 with (2, 2) -> (2, 2) becomes activated.
Thus, the activated points are (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 2), so 3 points in
total. We can show this is the maximum activated.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: points = [[2,3],[2,2],[1,1],[4,5]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Adding and activating a point such as (2, 1) causes
activations:
- (2, 1) shares x = 2 with (2, 3) and (2, 2) -> (2, 3) and (2, 2) become
  activated.
- (2, 1) shares y = 1 with (1, 1) -> (1, 1) becomes activated.
Thus, the activated points are (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1), so 4 points
in total.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= points.length <= 10⁵`
- `points[i] = [xi, yi]`
- `-10⁹ <= xi, yi <= 10⁹`
- `points contains all distinct coordinates.`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use disjoint-set union (DSU).

### Hint 2

Build components by unioning points that share the same x or the same y.

### Hint 3

Each x maps to one component and each y maps to one component. Adding (x0,
y0) connects at most two distinct components; activated = size(A) + size(B)
+ 1 (if same component then size(A) + 1).

### Hint 4

Maximize by choosing the two components with largest size; if only one
component, answer = n + 1.
