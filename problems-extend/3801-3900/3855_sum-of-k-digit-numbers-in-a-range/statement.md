# Sum of K-Digit Numbers in a Range

## Description

You are given three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`.

Consider all possible integers consisting of exactly `k` digits, where each
digit is chosen independently from the integer range `[l, r]` (inclusive). If
`0` is included in the range, leading zeros are allowed.

Return an integer representing the sum of all such numbers. Since the answer
may be very large, return it modulo `10⁹ + 7`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: l = 1, r = 2, k = 2
Output: 66
Explanation: All numbers formed using k = 2 digits in the range [1, 2] are
11, 12, 21, 22. The total sum is 11 + 12 + 21 + 22 = 66.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: l = 0, r = 1, k = 3
Output: 444
Explanation: All numbers formed using k = 3 digits in the range [0, 1] are
000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111. These numbers without leading zeros
are 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111. The total sum is 444.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: l = 5, r = 5, k = 10
Output: 555555520
Explanation: 5555555555 is the only valid number consisting of k = 10 digits
in the range [5, 5]. The total sum is 5555555555 % (10⁹ + 7) = 555555520.
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= l <= r <= 9`
- `1 <= k <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use combinatorics.

### Hint 2

For some position p among the k digits, the sum is 10^p * (l + (l+1) + ... +
r) * (r - l + 1)^(k-1).

### Hint 3

Summing p over [0, k-1] gives (l + (l+1) + ... + r) * (r - l + 1)^(k-1) *
(10^k - 1) / 9.
