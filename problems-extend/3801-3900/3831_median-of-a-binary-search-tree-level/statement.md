# Median of a Binary Search Tree Level

## Description

You are given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an integer level.

The root node is at level 0. Each level represents the distance from the
root.

Return the median value of all node values present at the given level. If
the level does not exist or contains no nodes, return -1.

The median is defined as the middle element after sorting the values at
that level in non-decreasing order. If the number of values at that level
is even, return the upper median (the larger of the two middle elements
after sorting).

### Example 1

```text
Input: root = [4,null,5,null,7], level = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: The nodes at level = 2 are [7]. The median value is 7.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [6,3,8], level = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: The nodes at level = 1 are [3, 8]. There are two possible
median values, so the larger one 8 is the answer.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: root = [2,1], level = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no node present at level = 2, so the answer is -1.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2 * 10⁵]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10⁶`
- `0 <= level <= 2 * 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use DFS or BFS to gather the node values at level.

### Hint 2

Sort the values at that level; if the list is empty, return -1, otherwise
return the upper median.
