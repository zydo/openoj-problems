# Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered
from 1 to `n`. You are also given a 2D array `roads` where
`roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei]` indicates that there is a bidirectional
road between cities `ai` and `bi` with a distance equal to `distancei`.
The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum
distance of a road in this path.

Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities `1` and `n`.

Note:

- A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
- It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and
  you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.
- The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path
  between `1` and `n`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
It can be shown that no other path has less score.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= roads.length <= 10⁵`
- `roads[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
- `ai != bi`
- `1 <= distancei <= 10⁴`
- There are no repeated edges.
- There is at least one path between `1` and `n`.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Can you solve the problem if the whole graph is connected?

### Hint 2

Notice that if the graph is connected, you can always use any edge of
the graph in your path.

### Hint 3

How to solve the general problem in a similar way? Remove all the nodes
that are not connected to `1` and `n`, then apply the previous solution
in the new graph.
