# Word Abbreviation

## Description

Given an array of **distinct** strings `words`, return the minimal possible
abbreviations for every word.

The following are the rules for a string abbreviation:

- The initial abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the
  number of characters in between, followed by the last character.
- If more than one word shares the same abbreviation, then perform the
  following operation: increase the prefix (characters in the first part) of
  each of their abbreviations by 1.

For example, say you start with the words `["abcdef","abndef"]`, both
initially abbreviated as `"a4f"`. Then, a sequence of operations would be
`["a4f","a4f"] -> ["ab3f","ab3f"] -> ["abc2f","abn2f"]`.

- This operation is repeated until every abbreviation is unique.
- At the end, if an abbreviation did not make a word shorter, then keep it as
  the original word.

### Example 1

```text
Input: words = ["like","god","internal","me","internet","interval","intension","face","intrusion"]
Output: ["l2e","god","internal","me","i6t","interval","inte4n","f2e","intr4n"]
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: words = ["aa","aaa"]
Output: ["aa","aaa"]
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= words.length <= 400`
- `2 <= words[i].length <= 400`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `words` are unique.
