        # shared path buffer holds a character per active root->node
        # frame: descending appends, unwinding pops, so no frame ever
        # carries a copy of its parent's path, and the buffer is reversed
        # into a candidate string only at a leaf. Python's own `<` does
        # the comparing — code point by code point, strict prefix smaller
        # — which is exactly the statement's rule.
        # Iterative on purpose: the 8500-node chain the constraints allow
        # is far deeper than CPython's default recursion limit; the
        # explicit stack is one entry per node or unwind marker and never
        # nests a call.
