// The judge pins one exact answer: the even values in the order they appear,
// then the odd values in the order they appear. One scan routes each value
// into its group as it is read — a value's arrival order inside its group is
// its input order, so the concatenation of the two groups is the answer, with
// no value compared by magnitude.
