// Judge-provided case carrier for this problem (not editable here; the
// judge assembles this source into every submission):
//   CounterCase carries one case's script: .n is the starting integer and
//   .calls holds one "call" entry per required invocation. drive() is
//   called by the submission with its createCounter — the driver builds
//   the counter with n, invokes it once per entry, and checks each return
//   is an integer. The recorded list of returns, read back by verdict(),
//   is the judged answer.
