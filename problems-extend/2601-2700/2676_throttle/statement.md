# Throttle

## Description

Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a throttled version
of that function.

A throttled function is first called without delay and then, for a time
interval of t milliseconds, can't be executed but should store the latest
function arguments provided to call fn with them after the end of the delay.

For instance, t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 40ms, and 60ms.

At 30ms, without delay, the throttled function fn should be called with the
arguments, and calling the throttled function fn should be blocked for the
following t milliseconds.

At 40ms, the function should just save arguments.

At 60ms, arguments should overwrite currently stored arguments from the
second call because the second and third calls are made before 80ms. Once
the delay has passed, the throttled function fn should be called with the
latest arguments provided during the delay period, and it should also create
another delay period of 80ms + t.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only — LeetCode offers no other languages for it. It is also judged on a
deterministic virtual clock instead of real timers: your submission declares
`function throttle(fn, t)` plus a class Solution whose `run` method hands
your function to the bundle-provided driver: `throttleCase.drive(throttle)`.
During `drive` the driver replaces the global `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`
with virtual-clock equivalents — it replays the case's calls at their
recorded times in order, flushes any timer whose deadline has been reached
before each call proceeds (earlier deadlines first, exactly as Node drains
its timer queue), then runs every surviving timer to completion. Each actual
execution of your wrapped fn records one output row
`{"t": <virtual execution time>, "inputs": [...]}` in execution order; that
recorded transcript is the judged answer shown as `Output` below. Never
bypass the timers (no setImmediate or synchronous calls) — only executions
scheduled through setTimeout/clearTimeout count.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
t = 100,
calls = [
  {"t":20,"inputs":[1]}
]
Output: [{"t":20,"inputs":[1]}]
Explanation: The 1st call is always called without delay
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
t = 50,
calls = [
  {"t":50,"inputs":[1]},
  {"t":75,"inputs":[2]}
]
Output: [{"t":50,"inputs":[1]},{"t":100,"inputs":[2]}]
Explanation:
The 1st is called a function with arguments (1) without delay.
The 2nd is called at 75ms, within the delay period because 50ms + 50ms =
100ms, so the next call can be reached at 100ms. Therefore, we save
arguments from the 2nd call to use them at the callback of the 1st call.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
t = 70,
calls = [
  {"t":50,"inputs":[1]},
  {"t":75,"inputs":[2]},
  {"t":90,"inputs":[8]},
  {"t": 140, "inputs":[5,7]},
  {"t": 300, "inputs": [9,4]}
]
Output: [{"t":50,"inputs":[1]},{"t":120,"inputs":[8]},{"t":190,"inputs":[5,7]},{"t":300,"inputs":[9,4]}]
Explanation:
The 1st is called a function with arguments (1) without delay.
The 2nd is called at 75ms within the delay period because 50ms + 70ms =
120ms, so it should only save arguments.
The 3rd is also called within the delay period, and because we need just
the latest function arguments, we overwrite previous ones. After the delay
period, we do a callback at 120ms with saved arguments. That callback makes
another delay period of 120ms + 70ms = 190ms so that the next function can
be called at 190ms.
The 4th is called at 140ms in the delay period, so it should be called as a
callback at 190ms. That will create another delay period of 190ms + 70ms =
260ms.
The 5th is called at 300ms, but it is after 260ms, so it should be called
immediately and should create another delay period of 300ms + 70ms = 370ms.
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= t <= 1000`
- `1 <= calls.length <= 10`
- `0 <= calls[i].t <= 1000`
- `0 <= calls[i].inputs[j], calls[i].inputs.length <= 10`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Store a variable for currArguments.

### Hint 2

If no timeout is in progress, immediately execute the function and create a timeout. If a timeout is in progress, set the currArguments to the new arguments.

### Hint 3

When the timeout is done: if currArguments is null, do nothing. Otherwise, execute the function with currArguments and create another timeout.
