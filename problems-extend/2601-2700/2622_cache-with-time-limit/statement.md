# Cache With Time Limit

## Description

Write a class that allows getting and setting key-value pairs, however a
time until expiration is associated with each key.

The class has three public methods:

- `set(key, value, duration)`: accepts an integer key, an integer value,
  and a duration in milliseconds. Once the duration has elapsed, the key
  should be inaccessible. The method should return true if the same
  un-expired key already exists and false otherwise. Both the value and
  duration should be overwritten if the key already exists.
- `get(key)`: if an un-expired key exists, it should return the associated
  value. Otherwise it should return -1.
- `count()`: returns the count of un-expired keys.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only — LeetCode offers no other languages for it. Your submission declares
`class TimeLimitedCache` with the three methods above; the generated
`class Solution` keeps its `run(cacheCase)` method, whose body hands your
class to the judge-provided driver: `cacheCase.drive(TimeLimitedCache)`.
The driver replays the case's `actions`/`values` script alongside its
per-action `timeDelays`, where `timeDelays[i]` is the elapsed time in
milliseconds from the replay's start at which action i executes (the
leading constructor action starts at t=0). During the replay all time runs
on a deterministic virtual clock — `Date.now()` and `performance.now()`
report simulated milliseconds and `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` schedule and
cancel against them — so natural implementations behave exactly as they
would under wall-clock time, without actually waiting. One output row is
recorded per action: null for the construction, then each method's return
value (a boolean from set, a number from get, a number from count). That
recorded transcript is the judged output shown as Output below.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
actions = ["TimeLimitedCache", "set", "get", "count", "get"]
values = [[], [1, 42, 100], [1], [], [1]]
timeDelays = [0, 0, 50, 50, 150]
Output: [null, false, 42, 1, -1]
Explanation:
At t=0, the cache is constructed.
At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 100ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
At t=50, key=1 is requested and the value of 42 is returned.
At t=50, count() is called and there is one active key in the cache.
At t=100, key=1 expires.
At t=150, get(1) is called but -1 is returned because the cache is empty.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
actions = ["TimeLimitedCache", "set", "set", "get", "get", "get", "count"]
values = [[], [1, 42, 50], [1, 50, 100], [1], [1], [1], []]
timeDelays = [0, 0, 40, 50, 120, 200, 250]
Output: [null, false, true, 50, 50, -1, 0]
Explanation:
At t=0, the cache is constructed.
At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 50ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.
At t=40, a key-value pair (1: 50) is added with a time limit of 100ms. A non-expired value already existed so true is returned and the old value was overwritten.
At t=50, get(1) is called which returned 50.
At t=120, get(1) is called which returned 50.
At t=140, key=1 expires.
At t=200, get(1) is called but the cache is empty so -1 is returned.
At t=250, count() returns 0 because the cache is empty.
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= key, value <= 10⁹`
- `0 <= duration <= 1000`
- `1 <= actions.length <= 100`
- `actions.length === values.length`
- `actions.length === timeDelays.length`
- `0 <= timeDelays[i] <= 1450`
- `actions[i]` is one of "TimeLimitedCache", "set", "get" and "count"
- First action is always "TimeLimitedCache" and must be executed
  immediately, with a 0-millisecond delay

## Hints

### Hint 1

You can delay execution of code with "ref = setTimeout(fn, delay)". You can abort the execution with "clearTimeout(ref)"

### Hint 2

When storing the values in the cache, also store a reference to the timeout. The timeout should clear the key from the cache after the expiration has elapsed.

### Hint 3

When you set a key that already exists, clear the existing timeout.
