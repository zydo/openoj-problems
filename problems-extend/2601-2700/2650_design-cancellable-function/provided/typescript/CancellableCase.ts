// Problem-provided driver for 2650 design-cancellable-function. Assembled
// into every submission by the judge ahead of the submitted code; never
// editable in the editor. This file is the hidden implementation — solvers
// see only the public API documented in the statement.
//
// The driver owns one case's generatorFunction source and cancelledAt.
// drive() receives the submission's cancellable function, instantiates the
// generator, calls cancellable(generator) exactly once, arms
// setTimeout(cancel, cancelledAt) when cancelledAt is not null, pumps
// every scheduled settlement in due-time order with microtask checkpoints
// between fires, and adopts the returned promise's fate as this case's
// judged outcome object.
//
// TIMING IS VIRTUAL. The clock below replaces setTimeout globally before
// the submission source is evaluated, so the generator internals and the
// driver's own cancel timer arm delays on the same deterministic schedule;
// real time has no influence on what is judged — only which side of each
// race settles first on the shared clock.
