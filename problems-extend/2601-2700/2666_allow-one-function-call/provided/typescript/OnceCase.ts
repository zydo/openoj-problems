// Problem-provided driver for 2666 allow-one-function-call. Assembled
// into every submission by the judge ahead of the submitted code; never
// editable in the editor. This file is the hidden implementation —
// solvers see only the public API documented in the statement.
//
// The driver owns one case's fn/calls script (the same shape as the
// statement's Input). drive() receives the submission's once function,
// builds the underlying function named by the case's source string,
// wraps it in a call-counting shim, then replays the calls rows through
// whatever once() handed back: row 0 must return the shim's recorded
// result, and every later row must come back as undefined or the run is
// rejected. The judged verdict is [{"calls": K, "value": V}] — how many
// times the underlying function itself was invoked, and what that one
// invocation returned.
