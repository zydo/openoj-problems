# Group By

## Description

Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the
array.groupBy(fn) method on any array and it will return a grouped version of
the array.

A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and
each value is an array containing all items in the original array which
generate that key.

The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string
key.

The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the
array. Any order of keys is acceptable.

Please solve it without lodash's _.groupBy function.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript only —
LeetCode offers no other languages for it. Your submission declares
`class Solution` with the method `groupBy(groupCase)`, where `groupCase` is a
judge-provided `GroupCase` carrying `.fn`, the callable built from the case's
function source, and `.array`, the array to group. Enhance
`Array.prototype` with `groupBy`, then return the value of invoking
`groupCase.array.groupBy(groupCase.fn)`. Each value list keeps its items in
array order; the judged comparison treats the returned object's key order as
irrelevant, matching "any order of keys is acceptable".

### Example 1

```text
Input:
array = [
  {"id":"1"},
  {"id":"1"},
  {"id":"2"}
],
fn = function (item) {
  return item.id;
}
Output:
{
  "1": [{"id": "1"}, {"id": "1"}],
  "2": [{"id": "2"}]
}
Explanation:
Output is from array.groupBy(fn).
The selector function gets the "id" out of each item in the array.
There are two objects with an "id" of 1. Both of those objects are put in the
first array.
There is one object with an "id" of 2. That object is put in the second
array.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
array = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [1, 3, 5],
  [1, 5, 9]
]
fn = function (list) {
  return String(list[0]);
}
Output:
{
  "1": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]]
}
Explanation:
The array can be of any type. In this case, the selector function defines the
key as being the first element in the array.
All the arrays have 1 as their first element so they are grouped together.
{
  "1": [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 5, 9]]
}
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
fn = function (n) {
  return String(n > 5);
}
Output:
{
  "true": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
  "false": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
Explanation:
The selector function splits the array by whether each number is greater
than 5.
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= array.length <= 10⁵`
- `fn returns a string`

## Hints

### Hint 1

First declare an object that will eventually be returned.

### Hint 2

Iterate of each element in the array. You can access the array with the
"this" keyword.

### Hint 3

The key is fn(arr[i]). If the key already exists on the object, set the value
to be an empty array. Then push the value onto the array at the key.
