# Array Reduce Transformation

## Description

Given an integer array nums, a reducer function fn, and an initial value
init, return the final result obtained by executing the fn function on each
element of the array, sequentially, passing in the return value from the
calculation on the preceding element.

This result is achieved through the following operations: val = fn(init,
nums[0]), val = fn(val, nums[1]), val = fn(val, nums[2]), ... until every
element in the array has been processed. The ultimate value of val is then
returned.

If the length of the array is 0, the function should return init.

Please solve it without using the built-in Array.reduce method.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only — LeetCode offers no other languages for it. Your submission declares
`function reduce(nums, fn, init)` plus a class Solution whose `reduce`
method hands your function to the judge-provided case carrier:
`reduceCase.nums`, `reduceCase.fn` and `reduceCase.init` are the case's
inputs (fn built from its source text), so the method's job is to return
`reduce(reduceCase.nums, reduceCase.fn, reduceCase.init)`. That returned
number is the judged answer, compared exactly.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr; }
init = 0
Output: 10
Explanation:
initially, the value is init=0.
(0) + nums[0] = 1
(1) + nums[1] = 3
(3) + nums[2] = 6
(6) + nums[3] = 10
The final answer is 10.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr * curr; }
init = 100
Output: 130
Explanation:
initially, the value is init=100.
(100) + nums[0] * nums[0] = 101
(101) + nums[1] * nums[1] = 105
(105) + nums[2] * nums[2] = 114
(114) + nums[3] * nums[3] = 130
The final answer is 130.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
nums = []
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return 0; }
init = 25
Output: 25
Explanation: For empty arrays, the answer is always init.
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= init <= 1000`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Declare a variable "res" and set it it equal to the initial value.

### Hint 2

Loop over each value in the array and set "res" = fn(res, arr[i]).
