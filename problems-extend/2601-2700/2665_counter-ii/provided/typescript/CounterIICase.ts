// Judge-provided case carrier for this problem (not editable here; the
// judge assembles this source into every submission):
//   CounterIICase carries one case's script: .init is the starting integer
//   and .calls holds one method name per required invocation. drive() is
//   called by the submission with its createCounter — the driver builds the
//   counter object with init, invokes the requested method once per entry,
//   and checks each return is an integer. The recorded list of returns,
//   read back by verdict(), is the judged answer.
