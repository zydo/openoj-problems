// Judge-provided driver for 2629 function composition. Assembled into
// every submission by the judge ahead of the submitted code; never
// editable in the editor. This file is the hidden implementation —
// solvers see only the public API documented in the statement.
//
// The driver owns one case's functions/x script (the same shape as the
// statement's Input). drive() receives the submission's compose function,
// builds each case source into a live callable, wraps every callable in a
// counting shim, and hands the wrapped array to compose(). It requires a
// function back, calls that composed function once at x, and records the
// returned integer. verdict() then insists every supplied function was
// called exactly once — threading an input through the whole chain is the
// problem's contract — before reporting the recorded value.

    // The interactive wrapper hands the oracle one array of the manifest's
    // construct values (functions, x) plus the query budget (unused — a
    // single one-shot evaluation needs no call accounting).
