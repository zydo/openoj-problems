# Find the Width of Columns of a Grid

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed `m x n` integer matrix `grid`. The width of a
column is the maximum length of its integers.

	For example, if grid = [[-10], [3], [12]], the width of the only column is 3 since -10 is of length 3.

Return an integer array `ans` of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the width of the
ith column.

The length of an integer `x` with `len` digits is equal to `len` if `x` is
non-negative, and `len + 1` otherwise.

### Example 1

```text
Input: grid = [[1],[22],[333]]
Output: [3]
Explanation: In the 0th column, 333 is of length 3.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: grid = [[-15,1,3],[15,7,12],[5,6,-2]]
Output: [3,1,2]
Explanation:
In the 0th column, only -15 is of length 3.
In the 1st column, all integers are of length 1.
In the 2nd column, both 12 and -2 are of length 2.
```

### Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-10⁹ <= grid[r][c] <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

You can find the length of a number by dividing it by 10 and then rounding it down again and again until this number becomes equal to 0. Add 1 if this number is negative.

### Hint 2

Traverse the matrix column-wise to find the maximum length in each column.
