// bundle-provided case carrier for this problem (not editable here; the
// judge assembles this source into every submission):

//   callable built from the case's function source, .inputs are the
//   arguments for that single time limited call, and .t is the limit in
//   virtual milliseconds.
//
//   TIMING IS VIRTUAL. The clock below replaces setTimeout globally
//   before the submission source is evaluated, so the fn internals and
//   the submission's own limit timer arm delays on the same deterministic
//   schedule; real time has no influence on what is judged — only which
//   side of the race settles.
