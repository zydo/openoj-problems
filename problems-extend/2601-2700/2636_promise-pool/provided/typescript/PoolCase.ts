// bundle-provided case carrier for this problem (not editable here; the
// judge assembles this source into every submission):
//   PoolCase turns this case's function specs into live promise-returning
//   functions on a deterministic virtual clock — calling functions[i]()
//   starts job i at the current tick and its promise settles at
//   start + delay, while the carrier records both ticks. drive() hands
//   the live functions and the pool limit to the submission's
//   promisePool, pumps every scheduled settlement in due-time order with
//   full-drain barriers between fires, awaits the returned promise, and
//   verdict() reports [[start ticks], [end ticks]]. Real time and real
//   timers have no influence on what is judged; only the schedule is.
