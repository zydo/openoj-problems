# Color the Triangle Red

## Description

You are given an integer `n`. Consider an equilateral triangle of side
length `n`, broken up into `n²` unit equilateral triangles. The triangle
has `n` 1-indexed rows where the ith row has `2i - 1` unit equilateral
triangles.

The triangles in the ith row are also 1-indexed with coordinates from
`(i, 1)` to `(i, 2i - 1)`.

Two triangles are neighbors if they share a side. For example:

- Triangles `(1,1)` and `(2,2)` are neighbors
- Triangles `(3,2)` and `(3,3)` are neighbors.
- Triangles `(2,2)` and `(3,3)` are not neighbors because they do not
  share any side.

Initially, all the unit triangles are white. You want to choose `k`
triangles and color them red. We will then run the following algorithm:

1. Choose a white triangle that has at least two red neighbors.
2. If there is no such triangle, stop the algorithm.
3. Color that triangle red.
4. Go to step 1.

Choose the minimum `k` possible and set `k` triangles red before running
this algorithm such that after the algorithm stops, all unit triangles are
colored red.

Return a 2D list of the coordinates of the triangles that you will color
red initially. The answer has to be of the smallest size possible. If
there are multiple valid solutions, return any.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 3
Output: [[1,1],[2,1],[2,3],[3,1],[3,5]]
Explanation: Initially, we choose the shown 5 triangles to be red. Then,
we run the algorithm:
- Choose (2,2) that has three red neighbors and color it red.
- Choose (3,2) that has two red neighbors and color it red.
- Choose (3,4) that has three red neighbors and color it red.
- Choose (3,3) that has three red neighbors and color it red.
It can be shown that choosing any 4 triangles and running the algorithm
will not make all triangles red.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 2
Output: [[1,1],[2,1],[2,3]]
Explanation: Initially, we choose the shown 3 triangles to be red. Then,
we run the algorithm:
- Choose (2,2) that has three red neighbors and color it red.
It can be shown that choosing any 2 triangles and running the algorithm
will not make all triangles red.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 1000`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Calculate the minimal value of k by strategically designing a monovariant.

### Hint 2

Construct the solution four rows at a time, going bottom up.
