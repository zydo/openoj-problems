# Immutability Helper

## Description

Creating clones of immutable objects with minor alterations can be a tedious
process. Write a class ImmutableHelper that serves as a tool to help with
this requirement. The constructor accepts an immutable object obj which
will be a JSON object or array.

The class has a single method produce which accepts a function mutator. The
function returns a new object which is similar to the original except it has
those mutations applied.

mutator accepts a proxied version of obj. A user of this function can
(appear to) mutate this object, but the original object obj should not
actually be effected.

For example, a user could write code like this:

```js
const originalObj = { x: 5 };
const helper = new ImmutableHelper(originalObj);
const newObj = helper.produce((proxy) => {
    proxy.x = proxy.x + 1;
});
console.log(originalObj); // {"x": 5}
console.log(newObj); // {"x": 6}
```

Properties of the mutator function:

- It will always return undefined.
- It will never access keys that don't exist.
- It will never delete keys (delete obj.key)
- It will never call methods on a proxied object (push, shift, etc).
- It will never set keys to objects (proxy.x = {})

Note on how the solution will be tested: the solution validator will only
analyze differences between what was returned and the original obj. Doing a
full comparison would be too computationally expensive. Also, any mutations
to the original object will result in a wrong answer.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only — LeetCode offers no other languages for it. Your submission declares
`class Solution` with the method `run(imCase)`, where `imCase` is a
judge-provided `ImCase` carrying `.obj`, the immutable object under test,
and `.mutators`, the list of mutation scripts to apply. Declare
`class ImmutableHelper` as well, then call `imCase.drive(ImmutableHelper)`:
the driver constructs the helper on `imCase.obj` and calls `produce` once
per script with a function that applies that script's edits to the proxy.
The judged verdict pairs the array of produced results with `imCase.obj`
after all calls — the original must still equal its initial JSON.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
obj = {"val": 10},
mutators = [
  proxy => { proxy.val += 1; },
  proxy => { proxy.val -= 1; }
]
Output:
[
  {"val": 11},
  {"val": 9}
]
Explanation:
const helper = new ImmutableHelper({val: 10});
helper.produce(proxy => { proxy.val += 1; }); // { "val": 11 }
helper.produce(proxy => { proxy.val -= 1; }); // { "val": 9 }
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
obj = {"arr": [1, 2, 3]}
mutators = [
 proxy => {
   proxy.arr[0] = 5;
   proxy.newVal = proxy.arr[0] + proxy.arr[1];
 }
]
Output:
[
  {"arr": [5, 2, 3], "newVal": 7 }
]
Explanation: Two edits were made to the original array. The first element in the array was to set 5. Then a new key was added with a value of 7.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
obj = {"obj": {"val": {"x": 10, "y": 20}}}
mutators = [
  proxy => {
    let data = proxy.obj.val;
    let temp = data.x;
    data.x = data.y;
    data.y = temp;
  }
]
Output:
[
  {"obj": {"val": {"x": 20, "y": 10}}}
]
Explanation: The values of "x" and "y" were swapped.
```

### Constraints

- 2 <= JSON.stringify(obj).length <= 4 * 10⁵
- mutators is an array of functions
- total calls to produce() < 10⁵

## Hints

### Hint 1

Javascript has the concept of Proxy. That concept is critical to this problem.

### Hint 2

You you need to keep track of which values in the JSON were overwritten with new values.

### Hint 3

Somehow, keep a tree structure that exists parallel to the original object. This will keep track of all the edits.

### Hint 4

When the mutator function is done. Return a clone with those mutations applied. It will be inefficient to clone the entire object so only clone the minimum number of nodes.
