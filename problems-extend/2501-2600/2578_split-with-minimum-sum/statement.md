# Split With Minimum Sum

## Description

Given a positive integer num, split it into two non-negative integers
num1 and num2 such that:

- The concatenation of num1 and num2 is a permutation of num.

  In other words, the sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in
  num1 and num2 is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in
  num.

- num1 and num2 can contain leading zeros.

Return the minimum possible sum of num1 and num2.

Notes:

- It is guaranteed that num does not contain any leading zeros.
- The order of occurrence of the digits in num1 and num2 may differ from
  the order of occurrence of num.

### Example 1

```text
Input: num = 4325
Output: 59
Explanation: We can split 4325 so that num1 is 24 and num2 is 35,
giving a sum of 59. We can prove that 59 is indeed the minimal possible
sum.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: num = 687
Output: 75
Explanation: We can split 687 so that num1 is 68 and num2 is 7, which
would give an optimal sum of 75.
```

### Constraints

- `10 <= num <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Sort the digits of num in non decreasing order.

### Hint 2

Assign digits to num1 and num2 alternatively.
