# Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal

## Description

You are given two 0-indexed binary strings s and target of the same length
n. You can do the following operation on s any number of times:

- Choose two different indices `i` and `j` where `0 <= i, j < n`.
- Simultaneously, replace `s[i]` with `(s[i] OR s[j])` and `s[j]` with
`(s[i] XOR s[j])`.

For example, if s = "0110", you can choose i = 0 and j = 2, then
simultaneously replace s[0] with (s[0] OR s[2] = 0 OR 1 = 1), and s[2]
with (s[0] XOR s[2] = 0 XOR 1 = 1), so we will have s = "1110".

Return true if you can make the string s equal to target, or false
otherwise.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "1010", target = "0110"
Output: true
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose i = 2 and j = 0. We have now s = "0010".
- Choose i = 2 and j = 1. We have now s = "0110".
Since we can make s equal to target, we return true.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "11", target = "00"
Output: false
Explanation: It is not possible to make s equal to target with any number
of operations.
```

### Constraints

- `n == s.length == target.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `s` and `target` consist of only the digits 0 and 1.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Think of when it is impossible to convert the string to the target.

### Hint 2

If exactly one of the strings is having all 0’s, then it is impossible.
And it is possible in all other cases. Why is that true?
