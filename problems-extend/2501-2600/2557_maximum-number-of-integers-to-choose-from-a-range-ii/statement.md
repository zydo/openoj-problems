# Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range II

## Description

You are given an integer array banned and two integers n and maxSum. You
are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:

- The chosen integers have to be in the range `[1, n]`.
- Each integer can be chosen at most once.
- The chosen integers should not be in the array banned.
- The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed maxSum.

Return the maximum number of integers you can choose following the
mentioned rules.

### Example 1

```text
Input: banned = [1,4,6], n = 6, maxSum = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: You can choose the integer 3.
3 is in the range [1, 6], and do not appear in banned. The sum of the
chosen integers is 3, which does not exceed maxSum.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: banned = [4,3,5,6], n = 7, maxSum = 18
Output: 3
Explanation: You can choose the integers 1, 2, and 7.
All these integers are in the range [1, 7], all do not appear in banned,
and their sum is 10, which does not exceed maxSum.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= banned.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= banned[i] <= n <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= maxSum <= 10¹⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

It is optimal always to take the smallest possible integer you can
choose.

### Hint 2

Between every consecutive banned integers, can you find how many integers
you can choose?

### Hint 3

Think of using binary search to find that.
