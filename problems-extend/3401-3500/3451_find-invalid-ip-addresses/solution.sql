-- Three independent ways to be invalid: the wrong number of octets (a dot
-- count other than three), a leading zero inside an octet, or an octet
-- value above 255. The dot count is length arithmetic on REPLACE, and
-- when it is exactly three, instr/substr peels the address into its four
-- octets for the per-octet checks.
