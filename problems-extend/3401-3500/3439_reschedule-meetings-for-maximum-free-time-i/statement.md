# Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time I

## Description

You are given an integer `eventTime` denoting the duration of an event, where the
event occurs from time `t = 0` to time `t = eventTime`.

You are also given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime`, each of length
`n`. These represent the start and end time of `n` non-overlapping meetings,
where the `i`th meeting occurs during the time `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]`.

You can reschedule at most `k` meetings by moving their start time while
maintaining the same duration, to maximize the longest continuous period of free
time during the event.

The relative order of all the meetings should stay the same and they should
remain non-overlapping.

Return the maximum amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.

Note that the meetings can not be rescheduled to a time outside the event.

### Example 1

```text
Input: eventTime = 5, k = 1, startTime = [1,3], endTime = [2,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: Reschedule the meeting at [1, 2] to [2, 3], leaving no meetings
during the time [0, 2].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: eventTime = 10, k = 1, startTime = [0,2,9], endTime = [1,4,10]
Output: 6
Explanation: Reschedule the meeting at [2, 4] to [1, 3], leaving no meetings
during the time [3, 9].
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: eventTime = 5, k = 2, startTime = [0,1,2,3,4], endTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no time during the event not occupied by meetings.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= eventTime <= 10⁹`
- `n == startTime.length == endTime.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= k <= n`
- `0 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= eventTime`
- `endTime[i] <= startTime[i + 1]` where `i` lies in the range `[0, n - 2]`.

## Hints

### Hint 1

In a sequence of K meetings and K + 1 gaps, you could move all meetings to the
start of the sequence to get the max free time.

### Hint 2

Use a sliding window of K + 1 size to store sum of gaps and take the maximum.
