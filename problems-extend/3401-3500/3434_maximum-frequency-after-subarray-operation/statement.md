# Maximum Frequency After Subarray Operation

## Description

You are given an array `nums` of length `n`. You are also given an integer `k`.

You perform the following operation on `nums` once:

- Select a subarray `nums[i..j]` where `0 <= i <= j <= n - 1`.
- Select an integer `x` and add `x` to all the elements in `nums[i..j]`.

Find the maximum frequency of the value `k` after the operation.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: After adding -5 to nums[2..5], 1 has a frequency of 2 in [1, 2, -2, -1, 0, 1].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [10,2,3,4,5,5,4,3,2,2], k = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: After adding 8 to nums[1..9], 10 has a frequency of 4 in [10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 12, 11, 10, 10].
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `1 <= k <= 50`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Fix the element you want to convert to `k`.

### Hint 2

Use prefix sums to optimize counting occurrences of an element.
