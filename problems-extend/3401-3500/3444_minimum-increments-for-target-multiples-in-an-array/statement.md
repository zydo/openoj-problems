# Minimum Increments for Target Multiples in an Array

## Description

You are given two arrays, `nums` and `target`.

In a single operation, you may increment any element of `nums` by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations required so that each element in
`target` has at least one multiple in `nums`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = [4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The minimum number of operations required to satisfy the
condition is 1.

Increment 3 to 4 with just one operation, making 4 a multiple of itself.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [8,4], target = [10,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of operations required to satisfy the
condition is 2.

Increment 8 to 10 with 2 operations, making 10 a multiple of both 5 and 10.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [7,9,10], target = [7]
Output: 0
Explanation: Target 7 already has a multiple in nums, so no additional
operations are needed.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= target.length <= 4`
- `target.length <= nums.length`
- `1 <= nums[i], target[i] <= 10⁴`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use bitmask dynamic programming.
