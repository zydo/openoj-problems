# Merge BSTs to Create Single BST

## Description

You are given `n` BST (binary search tree) root nodes for `n` separate BSTs
stored in an array `trees` (0-indexed). Each BST in `trees` has at most 3
nodes, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:

- Select two distinct indices i and j such that the value stored at one of the leaves of trees[i] is equal to the root value of trees[j].
- Replace the leaf node in trees[i] with trees[j].
- Remove trees[j] from trees.

Return the root of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST
after performing `n - 1` operations, or null if it is impossible to create a
valid BST.

A BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the
following property:

- Every node in the node's left subtree has a value strictly less than the node's value.
- Every node in the node's right subtree has a value strictly greater than the node's value.

A leaf is a node that has no children.

Trees are given and returned in level-order form exactly as LeetCode
serializes them; a returned `null` root serializes as `[]`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: trees = [[2,1],[3,2,5],[5,4]]
Output: [3,2,5,1,null,4]
Explanation:
In the first operation, pick i=1 and j=0, and merge trees[0] into trees[1].
Delete trees[0], so trees = [[3,2,5,1],[5,4]].
In the second operation, pick i=0 and j=1, and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[3,2,5,1,null,4]].
The resulting tree, shown above, is a valid BST, so return its root.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: trees = [[5,3,8],[3,2,6]]
Output: []
Explanation:
Pick i=0 and j=1 and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[5,3,8,2,6]].
The resulting tree is shown above. This is the only valid operation that can be performed, but the resulting tree is not a valid BST, so return null.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: trees = [[5,4],[3]]
Output: []
Explanation: It is impossible to perform any operations.
```

### Constraints

- `n == trees.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10⁴`
- The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[1, 3]`.
- Each node in the input may have children but no grandchildren.
- No two roots of `trees` have the same value.
- All the trees in the input are valid BSTs.
- `1 <= TreeNode.val <= 5 * 10⁴`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Is it possible to have multiple leaf nodes with the same values?

### Hint 2

How many possible positions are there for each tree?

### Hint 3

The root value of the final tree does not occur as a value in any of the
leaves of the original tree.
