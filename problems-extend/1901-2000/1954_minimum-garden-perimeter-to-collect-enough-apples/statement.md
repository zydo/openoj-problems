# Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples

## Description

In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted
at every integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate
(i, j) has |i| + |j| apples growing on it.

You will buy an axis-aligned square plot of land that is centered at (0, 0).

Given an integer `neededApples`, return the minimum perimeter of a plot such
that at least `neededApples` apples are inside or on the perimeter of that
plot.

The value of `|x|` is defined as:

- `x` if `x >= 0`
- `-x` if `x < 0`

### Example 1

```text
Input: neededApples = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: A square plot of side length 1 does not contain any apples.
However, a square plot of side length 2 has 12 apples inside.
The perimeter is 2 * 4 = 8.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: neededApples = 13
Output: 16
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: neededApples = 1000000000
Output: 5040
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= neededApples <= 10¹⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Find a formula for the number of apples inside a square with a side length L.

### Hint 2

Iterate over the possible lengths of the square until enough apples are
collected.
