# Leetcodify Friends Recommendations

## Description

Table: `Listens`

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| user_id     | int  |
| song_id     | int  |
| day         | date |

This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key
for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table indicates that the user `user_id` listened to the song
`song_id` on the day `day`.

Table: `Friendship`

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| user1_id    | int  |
| user2_id    | int  |

In SQL,(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the users `user1_id` and `user2_id` are
friends.
Note that `user1_id` < `user2_id`.

Recommend friends to Leetcodify users. We recommend user x to user y if:

- Users x and y are not friends, and
- Users x and y listened to the same three or more different songs on the
  same day.

Note that friend recommendations are unidirectional, meaning if user x and
user y should be recommended to each other, the result table should have both
user x recommended to user y and user y recommended to user x. Also, note
that the result table should not contain duplicates (i.e., user y should not
be recommended to user x multiple times.).

Return the result table in any order.

Each testcase's `dataset` seeds the tables: its script inserts the testcase's
`Listens` and `Friendship` rows (whichever are present) before your query
runs. The result format is in the following example.

### Example 1

Input:
Listens table:
+---------+---------+------------+
| user_id | song_id | day        |

| 1       | 11      | 2021-03-15 |
| 1       | 12      | 2021-03-15 |
| 2       | 10      | 2021-03-15 |
| 2       | 11      | 2021-03-15 |
| 2       | 12      | 2021-03-15 |

| 5       | 11      | 2021-03-16 |
| 5       | 12      | 2021-03-16 |
+---------+---------+------------+
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
+----------+----------+
Output:
+---------+----------------+
| user_id | recommended_id |
+---------+----------------+
| 1       | 3              |
| 2       | 3              |
| 3       | 1              |
| 3       | 2              |
+---------+----------------+
Explanation:
Users 1 and 2 listened to songs 10, 11, and 12 on the same day, but they are already friends.
Users 1 and 3 listened to songs 10, 11, and 12 on the same day. Since they are not friends, we recommend them to each other.
Users 1 and 4 did not listen to the same three songs.
Users 1 and 5 listened to songs 10, 11, and 12, but on different days.

Similarly, we can see that users 2 and 3 listened to songs 10, 11, and 12 on the same day and are not friends, so we recommend them to each other.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning the recommendations
as rows `user_id` / `recommended_id` — each direction of each recommendation
exactly once, in any order.
