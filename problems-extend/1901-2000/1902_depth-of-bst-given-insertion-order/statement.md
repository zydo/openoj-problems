# Depth of BST Given Insertion Order

## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `order` of length `n`, a
permutation of integers from `1` to `n` representing the order of insertion
into a binary search tree.

A binary search tree is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the
  node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the
  node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

The binary search tree is constructed as follows:

- `order[0]` will be the root of the binary search tree.
- All subsequent elements are inserted as the child of any existing node such
  that the binary search tree properties hold.

Return the depth of the binary search tree.

A binary tree's depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the
root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example 1

```text
Input: order = [2,1,4,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary search tree has a depth of 3 with path 2->3->4.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: order = [2,1,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary search tree has a depth of 3 with path 2->3->4.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: order = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The binary search tree has a depth of 4 with path 1->2->3->4.
```

### Constraints

- `n == order.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `order` is a permutation of integers between `1` and `n`.

## Hints

### Hint 1

There are at most 2 possible places where a new node can be inserted?

### Hint 2

How can we keep track of the depth of each node?
