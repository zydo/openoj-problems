/**
 * A reverse preorder walk visits children before parents, so processing
 * the collected nodes back-to-front lets each node's subtree sum be built
 * from its children's already-computed sums. A node counts when its value
 * equals the sum of its descendants, i.e. its subtree sum minus its own
 * value. The traversal is fully iterative, so a 10^5-deep skewed tree
 * cannot overflow any stack. Subtree sums reach 10^5 * 10^5 = 10^10, so
 * they are kept in 64-bit space (a plain Number is exact below 2^53).
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
