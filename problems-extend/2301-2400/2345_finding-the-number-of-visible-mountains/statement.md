# Finding the Number of Visible Mountains

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `peaks` where
`peaks[i] = [xi, yi]` states that mountain `i` has a peak at coordinates
`(xi, yi)`. A mountain can be described as a right-angled isosceles
triangle, with its base along the x-axis and a right angle at its peak.
More formally, the gradients of ascending and descending the mountain are
`1` and `-1` respectively.

A mountain is considered visible if its peak does not lie within another
mountain (including the border of other mountains).

Return the number of visible mountains.

### Example 1

```text
Input: peaks = [[2,2],[6,3],[5,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The diagram above shows the mountains.
- Mountain 0 is visible since its peak does not lie within another
mountain or its sides.
- Mountain 1 is not visible since its peak lies within the side of
mountain 2.
- Mountain 2 is visible since its peak does not lie within another
mountain or its sides.
There are 2 mountains that are visible.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: peaks = [[1,3],[1,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The diagram above shows the mountains (they completely
overlap).
Both mountains are not visible since their peaks lie within each other.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= peaks.length <= 10⁵`
- `peaks[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= xi, yi <= 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

How can we efficiently find for each mountain the relevant mountains to
compare itself against to check whether or not it would be visible?

### Hint 2

Do you notice a pattern after sorting the peaks by their x-coordinates?

### Hint 3

After sorting, process the peaks sequentially and use a monotonic stack to
store currently visible mountains.
