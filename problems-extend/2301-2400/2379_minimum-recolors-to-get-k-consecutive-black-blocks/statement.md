# Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed string `blocks` of length `n`, where `blocks[i]`
is either `'W'` or `'B'`, representing the color of the ith block. The
characters `'W'` and `'B'` denote the colors white and black, respectively.

You are also given an integer `k`, which is the desired number of
consecutive black blocks.

In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a
black block.

Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least
one occurrence of `k` consecutive black blocks.

### Example 1

```text
Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor
the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW".
It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks
in less than 3 operations.
Therefore, we return 3.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks
already exist.
Therefore, we return 0.
```

### Constraints

- `n == blocks.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `blocks[i]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`.
- `1 <= k <= n`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Iterate through all possible consecutive substrings of k characters.

### Hint 2

Find the number of changes for each substring to make all blocks black, and
return the minimum of these.
