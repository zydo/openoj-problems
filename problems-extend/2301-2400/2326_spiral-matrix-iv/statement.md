# Spiral Matrix IV

## Description

You are given two integers `m` and `n`, which represent the dimensions of a
matrix.

You are also given the head of a linked list of integers.

Generate an `m x n` matrix that contains the integers in the linked list
presented in spiral order (clockwise), starting from the top-left of the
matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with `-1`.

Return the generated matrix.

### Example 1

```text
Input: m = 3, n = 5, head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]
Output: [[3,0,2,6,8],[5,0,-1,-1,1],[5,2,4,9,7]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.
Note that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: m = 1, n = 4, head = [0,1,2]
Output: [[0,1,2,-1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed from left to right in the matrix.
The last space in the matrix is set to -1.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= m, n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10⁵`
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, m * n]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Hints

### Hint 1

First, generate an m x n matrix filled with -1s.

### Hint 2

Navigate within the matrix at (i, j) with the help of a direction vector ⟨di, dj⟩. At (i, j), you need to decide if you can keep going in the current direction.

### Hint 3

If you cannot keep going, rotate the direction vector clockwise by 90 degrees.
