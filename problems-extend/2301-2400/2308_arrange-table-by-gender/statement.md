# Arrange Table by Gender

## Description

Table: `Genders`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| user_id     | int     |
| gender      | varchar |

`user_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
`gender` is an ENUM (category) of type `'female'`, `'male'`, or `'other'`.
Each row in this table contains the ID of a user and their gender.
The table has an equal number of `'female'`, `'male'`, and `'other'`.

Write a solution to rearrange the `Genders` table such that the rows
alternate between `'female'`, `'other'`, and `'male'` in order. The table
should be rearranged such that the IDs of each gender are sorted in
ascending order.

Return the result table in the mentioned order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Genders`
table with that testcase's rows. The result format is shown in the
following example.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
Genders table:
+---------+--------+
| user_id | gender |
+---------+--------+
| 4       | male   |
| 7       | female |
| 2       | other  |
| 5       | male   |
| 3       | female |
| 8       | male   |
| 6       | other  |
| 1       | other  |
| 9       | female |
+---------+--------+
Output:
+---------+--------+
| user_id | gender |
+---------+--------+
| 3       | female |
| 1       | other  |
| 4       | male   |
| 7       | female |
| 2       | other  |
| 5       | male   |
| 9       | female |
| 6       | other  |
| 8       | male   |
+---------+--------+
Explanation:
Female gender: IDs 3, 7, and 9.
Other gender: IDs 1, 2, and 6.
Male gender: IDs 4, 5, and 8.
We arrange the table alternating between 'female', 'other', and 'male'.
Note that the IDs of each gender are sorted in ascending order.
```

The rearrangement is a perfect interleaving of the three gender groups:
each gender's IDs are read in ascending order, then the rows are emitted
one ID from each group in turn, in the fixed cycle `'female'`, `'other'`,
`'male'`. Because the table holds an equal number of each gender, the
cycles exhaust all three groups at exactly the same row, so every row of
the output is fully determined. The `user_id` values are unique, so the
order is total — no two output rows can ever tie. Write your solution as
a single `SELECT` query returning two columns — `user_id` and `gender`,
in that order — with the rows in the exact alternating order described
above.
