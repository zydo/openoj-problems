# Integer Replacement

## Description

Given a positive integer `n`, you can apply one of the following operations:

- If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n / 2`.
- If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed for `n` to become `1`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: 7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
or 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 2³¹ - 1`
