# Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels

## Description

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `image` where `'0'` represents a white
pixel and `'1'` represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels
are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers `x` and `y` that represent the location of one of the black
pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that
encloses all black pixels.

You must write an algorithm with less than `O(mn)` runtime complexity.

### Example 1

```text
Input: image = [["0","0","1","0"],["0","1","1","0"],["0","1","0","0"]], x = 0, y = 2
Output: 6
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: image = [["1"]], x = 0, y = 0
Output: 1
```

### Constraints

- `m == image.length`
- `n == image[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `image[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
- `0 <= x < m`
- `0 <= y < n`
- `image[x][y] == '1'`.
- The black pixels in the image only form one component.
