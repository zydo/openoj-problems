# Line Reflection

## Description

Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to the
y-axis that reflects the given points symmetrically.

In other words, answer whether or not if there exists a line that after
reflecting all points over the given line, the original points' set is the
same as the reflected ones.

Note that there can be repeated points.

### Example 1

```text
Input: points = [[1,1],[-1,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can choose the line x = 0.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: points = [[1,1],[-1,-1]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can't choose a line.
```

### Constraints

- `n == points.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁴`
- `-10⁸ <= points[i][j] <= 10⁸`

### Follow-up

Could you do better than `O(n²)`?
