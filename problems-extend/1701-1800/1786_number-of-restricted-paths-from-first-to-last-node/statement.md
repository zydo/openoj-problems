# Number of Restricted Paths From First to Last Node

## Description

There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive
integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to
`n`, and an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]` denotes
that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight equal to
`weighti`.

A path from node `start` to node `end` is a sequence of nodes
`[z0, z1, z2, ..., zk]` such that `z0 = start` and `zk = end` and there is
an edge between `zi` and `zi+1` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path.
Let `distanceToLastNode(x)` denote the shortest distance of a path between
node `n` and node `x`. A restricted path is a path that also satisfies that
`distanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1)` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

Return the number of restricted paths from `1` to `n`. Since that number
may be too large, return it modulo `10⁹ + 7`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[2,3,1],[1,4,2],[5,2,2],[3,5,1],[5,4,10]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The three restricted paths are:
1) 1 --> 2 --> 5
2) 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5
3) 1 --> 3 --> 5
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,3,1],[4,1,2],[7,3,4],[2,5,3],[5,6,1],[6,7,2],[7,5,3],[2,6,4]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only restricted path is 1 --> 3 --> 7.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 4 * 10⁴`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
- `ui != vi`
- `1 <= weighti <= 10⁵`
- There is at most one edge between any two nodes.
- There is at least one path between any two nodes.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Run a Dijkstra from node numbered n to compute distance from the last node.

### Hint 2

Consider all edges [u, v] one by one and direct them such that distance of u
to n > distance of v to n. If both u and v are at the same distance from n,
discard this edge.

### Hint 3

Now this problem reduces to computing the number of paths from 1 to n in a
DAG, a standard DP problem.
