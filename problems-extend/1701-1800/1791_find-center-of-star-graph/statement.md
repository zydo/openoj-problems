# Find Center of Star Graph

## Description

There is an undirected star graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to
`n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly
`n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`
indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `ui` and `vi`. Return the
center of the given star graph.

### Example 1

```text
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints

- `3 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
- `ui != vi`
- The given edges represent a valid star graph.

## Hints

### Hint 1

The center is the only node that has more than one edge.

### Hint 2

The center is also connected to all other nodes.

### Hint 3

Any two edges must have a common node, which is the center.
