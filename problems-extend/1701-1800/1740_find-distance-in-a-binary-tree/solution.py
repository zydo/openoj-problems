        # and parent. Values are unique, so a value keys both maps. The
        # distance then resolves through the lowest common ancestor:
        # lift the deeper of p and q to the other's depth, walk both up
        # in lockstep until they meet — that meeting point is the LCA —
        # and return depth[p] + depth[q] - 2 * depth[lca], each leg of
        # the path counted once. p == q needs no special case: the lifts
        # make no move, the walk finds the two already equal, and the
        # formula cancels to 0. The root rides with parent None; no
        # climb ever passes the LCA, which is at the latest the root, so
        # the None is never dereferenced.
