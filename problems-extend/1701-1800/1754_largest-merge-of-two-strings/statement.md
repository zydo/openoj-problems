# Largest Merge Of Two Strings

## Description

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a
string `merge` in the following way: while either `word1` or `word2`
are non-empty, choose one of the following options:

- If `word1` is non-empty, append the first character in `word1` to
  `merge` and delete it from `word1`.

  For example, if `word1 = "abc"` and `merge = "dv"`, then after
  choosing this operation, `word1 = "bc"` and `merge = "dva"`.

- If `word2` is non-empty, append the first character in `word2` to
  `merge` and delete it from `word2`.

  For example, if `word2 = "abc"` and `merge = ""`, then after
  choosing this operation, `word2 = "bc"` and `merge = "a"`.

Return the lexicographically largest `merge` you can construct.

A string `a` is lexicographically larger than a string `b` (of the
same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a`
has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in
`b`. For example, `"abcd"` is lexicographically larger than `"abcc"`
because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and
`d` is greater than `c`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: word1 = "cabaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
Output: "cbcabaaaaa"
Explanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = "c", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cb", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "caaa"
- Take from word2: merge = "cbc", word1 = "abaa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbca", word1 = "baa", word2 = "aaa"
- Take from word1: merge = "cbcab", word1 = "aa", word2 = "aaa"
- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "abdcaba"
Output: "abdcabcabcaba"
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000`
- `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Build the result character by character. At each step, you choose a
character from one of the two strings.

### Hint 2

If the next character of the first string is larger than that of the
second string, or vice versa, it's optimal to use the larger one.

### Hint 3

If both are equal, think of a criteria that lets you decide which
string to consume the next character from.

### Hint 4

You should choose the next character from the larger string.
