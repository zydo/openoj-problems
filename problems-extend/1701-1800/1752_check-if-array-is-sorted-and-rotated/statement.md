# Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated

## Description

Given an array `nums`, return `true` if the array was originally sorted
in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions
(including zero). Otherwise, return `false`.

There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array `A` rotated by `x` positions results in an array `B` of
the same length such that `B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length]` for every
valid index `i`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 2 positions to begin on the element of
value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e., no rotation) to
make nums.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Brute force and check if it is possible for a sorted array to start
from each position.
