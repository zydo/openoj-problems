# Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths II

## Description

An undirected graph of `n` nodes is defined by `edgeList`, where
`edgeList[i] = [ui, vi, disi]` denotes an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`
with distance `disi`. Note that there may be multiple edges between two
nodes, and the graph may not be connected.

Implement the `DistanceLimitedPathsExist` class:

- `DistanceLimitedPathsExist(int n, int[][] edgeList)` initializes the
  class with an undirected graph.
- `boolean query(int p, int q, int limit)` returns `true` if there exists
  a path from `p` to `q` such that each edge on the path has a distance
  strictly less than `limit`, and `false` otherwise.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
["DistanceLimitedPathsExist", "query", "query", "query", "query"]
[[6, [[0, 2, 4], [0, 3, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 5]]], [2, 3, 2], [1, 3, 3], [2, 0, 3], [0, 5, 6]]
Output: [null, true, false, true, false]
Explanation:
DistanceLimitedPathsExist distanceLimitedPathsExist =
    new DistanceLimitedPathsExist(6, [[0, 2, 4], [0, 3, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [4, 5, 5]]);
distanceLimitedPathsExist.query(2, 3, 2); // return true. There is an edge from 2 to 3 of distance 1, which is less than 2.
distanceLimitedPathsExist.query(1, 3, 3); // return false. There is no way to go from 1 to 3 with distances strictly less than 3.
distanceLimitedPathsExist.query(2, 0, 3); // return true. There is a way to go from 2 to 0 with distance < 3: travel from 2 to 3 to 0.
distanceLimitedPathsExist.query(0, 5, 6); // return false. There are no paths from 0 to 5.
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= edgeList.length <= 10⁴`
- `edgeList[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi, p, q <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- `p != q`
- `1 <= disi, limit <= 10⁹`
- At most `10⁴` calls will be made to `query`.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Find the minimum spanning tree of the given graph.

### Hint 2

Root the tree in an arbitrary node and calculate the maximum weight of
the edge from each node to the chosen root.

### Hint 3

To answer a query, find the lca between the two nodes, and find the
maximum weight from each of the query nodes to their lca and compare it
to the given limit.
