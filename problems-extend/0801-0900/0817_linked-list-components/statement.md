# Linked List Components

## Description

You are given the `head` of a linked list containing unique integer values and
an integer array `nums` that is a subset of the linked list values.

Return the number of connected components in `nums`.

A connected component is a non-empty, maximal sequence of consecutive nodes in
the linked list such that every node's value belongs to `nums`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected
components.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: head = [0,1,2,3,4], nums = [0,3,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and
[3, 4] are the two connected components.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the linked list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= Node.val < n`
- All the values `Node.val` are unique.
- `1 <= nums.length <= n`
- `0 <= nums[i] < n`
- All the values of `nums` are unique.
