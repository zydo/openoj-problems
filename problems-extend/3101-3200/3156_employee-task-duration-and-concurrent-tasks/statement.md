# Employee Task Duration and Concurrent Tasks

## Description

Table: `Tasks`

| Column Name | Type     |
| ----------- | -------- |
| task_id     | int      |
| employee_id | int      |
| start_time  | datetime |
| end_time    | datetime |

(task_id, employee_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique
values) for this table.
Each row in this table contains the task identifier, the employee identifier,
and the start and end times of each task.

Write a solution to find the total duration of tasks for each employee and
the maximum number of concurrent tasks an employee handled at any point in
time. The total duration should be rounded down to the nearest number of full
hours.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id ascending order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Tasks` table with
that testcase's rows. The result format is in the following example.

Tasks table:
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| task_id | employee_id | start_time          | end_time            |
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| 1       | 1001        | 2023-05-01 08:00:00 | 2023-05-01 09:00:00 |
| 2       | 1001        | 2023-05-01 08:30:00 | 2023-05-01 10:30:00 |
| 3       | 1001        | 2023-05-01 11:00:00 | 2023-05-01 12:00:00 |
| 7       | 1001        | 2023-05-01 13:00:00 | 2023-05-01 15:30:00 |
| 4       | 1002        | 2023-05-01 09:00:00 | 2023-05-01 10:00:00 |
| 5       | 1002        | 2023-05-01 09:30:00 | 2023-05-01 11:30:00 |
| 6       | 1003        | 2023-05-01 14:00:00 | 2023-05-01 16:00:00 |
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+

Output:
+-------------+------------------+----------------------+
| employee_id | total_task_hours | max_concurrent_tasks |
+-------------+------------------+----------------------+
| 1001        | 6                | 2                    |
| 1002        | 2                | 2                    |
| 1003        | 2                | 1                    |
+-------------+------------------+----------------------+

Explanation:
For employee ID 1001:
  Task 1 and Task 2 overlap from 08:30 to 09:00 (30 minutes).
  Task 7 has a duration of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes).
  Total task time: 60 (Task 1) + 120 (Task 2) + 60 (Task 3) + 150 (Task 7)
  - 30 (overlap) = 360 minutes = 6 hours.
  Maximum concurrent tasks: 2 (during the overlap period).
For employee ID 1002:
  Task 4 and Task 5 overlap from 09:30 to 10:00 (30 minutes).
  Total task time: 60 (Task 4) + 120 (Task 5) - 30 (overlap) = 150 minutes =
  2 hours and 30 minutes.
  Total task hours (rounded down): 2 hours.
  Maximum concurrent tasks: 2 (during the overlap period).
For employee ID 1003:
  No overlapping tasks.
  Total task time: 120 minutes = 2 hours.
  Maximum concurrent tasks: 1.
Note: Output table is ordered by employee_id in ascending order.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning three columns —
`employee_id`, `total_task_hours`, and `max_concurrent_tasks` — where
`total_task_hours` counts each span of time only once even when tasks overlap,
floored to whole hours, and `max_concurrent_tasks` is the largest number of
the employee's tasks running at the same moment — one row per employee, in
ascending `employee_id` order. Return the result table in that order.
