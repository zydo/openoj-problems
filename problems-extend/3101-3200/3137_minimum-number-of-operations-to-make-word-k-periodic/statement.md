# Minimum Number of Operations to Make Word K-Periodic

## Description

You are given a string word of size n, and an integer k such that k divides n.

In one operation, you can pick any two indices i and j, that are divisible
by k, then replace the substring of length k starting at i with the
substring of length k starting at j. That is, replace the substring
word[i..i + k - 1] with the substring word[j..j + k - 1].

Return the minimum number of operations required to make word k-periodic.

We say that word is k-periodic if there is some string s of length k such
that word can be obtained by concatenating s an arbitrary number of times.
For example, if word == "ababab", then word is 2-periodic for s = "ab".

### Example 1

```text
Input: word = "leetcodeleet", k = 4
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can obtain a 4-periodic string by picking i = 4 and j = 0. After this
operation, word becomes equal to "leetleetleet".
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: word = "leetcoleet", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can obtain a 2-periodic string by applying the operations in the table below.

i    j    word

0    2    etetcoleet
4    0    etetetleet
6    0    etetetetet
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n == word.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= k <= word.length`
- `k` divides `word.length`.
- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Calculate the frequency of each substring of length k that starts at an
index that is divisible by k.

### Hint 2

The period of the final string will be the substring with the highest
frequency.
