# Equalize Strings by Adding or Removing Characters at Ends

## Description

Given two strings initial and target, your task is to modify initial by
performing a series of operations to make it equal to target.

In one operation, you can add or remove one character only at the beginning
or the end of the string initial.

Return the minimum number of operations required to transform initial into
target.

### Example 1

```text
Input: initial = "abcde", target = "cdef"
Output: 3
Explanation:
Remove 'a' and 'b' from the beginning of initial, then add 'f' to the end.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: initial = "axxy", target = "yabx"
Output: 6
Explanation:
Operation                 Resulting String

Add 'y' to the beginning  "yaxxy"
Remove from end           "yaxx"
Remove from end           "yax"
Remove from end           "ya"
Add 'b' to the end        "yab"
Add 'x' to the end        "yabx"
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: initial = "xyz", target = "xyz"
Output: 0
Explanation:
No operations are needed as the strings are already equal.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= initial.length, target.length <= 1000`
- `initial` and `target` consist only of lowercase English letters.
