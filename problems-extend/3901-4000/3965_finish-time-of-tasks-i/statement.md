# Finish Time of Tasks I

## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of tasks in a project,
numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. These tasks are connected as a tree rooted at
task `0`. This is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`,
where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that task `ui` is the parent of task
`vi`.

You are also given an array `baseTime` of length `n`, where `baseTime[i]`
represents the time to complete task `i`.

The finish time of each task is calculated as follows:

- Leaf task: The finish time is `baseTime[i]`.
- Non-leaf task:
  - Let `earliest` be the minimum finish time among its children, and
    `latest` be the maximum finish time among its children.
  - Let `ownDuration` be `(latest - earliest) + baseTime[i]`.
  - The finish time of task `i` is `latest + ownDuration`.

Return the finish time of the root task `0`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], baseTime = [9,5,3]
Output: 17
Explanation:
    Task 2 is a leaf, so its finish time is baseTime[2] = 3.
    Task 1 has one child task 2:
        earliest = latest = 3
        ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[1] = 5
        Finish time of task 1 is 3 + 5 = 8

    Task 0 has one child with finish time 8:
        earliest = latest = 8
        ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[0] = 9
        Finish time of task 0 is 8 + 9 = 17
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], baseTime = [4,7,6]
Output: 12
Explanation:
    Task 1 is a leaf, so its finish time is baseTime[1] = 7.
    Task 2 is a leaf, so its finish time is baseTime[2] = 6.
    Task 0 has two children with finish times 7 and 6:
        earliest = 6, latest = 7
        ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[0] = (7 - 6) + 4 = 5
        Finish time of task 0 is latest + ownDuration = 7 + 5 = 12
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3]], baseTime = [5,8,2,1]
Output: 18
Explanation:
    Task 1 is a leaf, so its finish time is baseTime[1] = 8.
    Task 3 is a leaf, so its finish time is baseTime[3] = 1.
    Task 2 has one child task 3:
        earliest = latest = 1
        ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[2] = 0 + 2 = 2
        Finish time of task 2 is latest + ownDuration = 1 + 2 = 3

    Task 0 has two children with finish times 8 and 3:
        earliest = 3, latest = 8
        ownDuration = (latest - earliest) + baseTime[0] = (8 - 3) + 5 = 10
        Finish time of task 0 is latest + ownDuration = 8 + 10 = 18
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `edges.length = n - 1`
- `edges[i] == [ui, vi]`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
- `baseTime.length == n`
- `1 <= baseTime[i] <= 10⁵`
- The finish time of every task is guaranteed to be less than `2⁵³`.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Build the children list from `edges`, since the tree is rooted and each edge
already points from parent to child.

### Hint 2

Compute finish times using a postorder DFS, so all children of a task are
processed before the task itself.

### Hint 3

For each non-leaf task, keep only the minimum and maximum finish times among
its children.
