# Number of Elapsed Seconds Between Two Times

## Description

You are given two valid times `startTime` and `endTime`, each represented as
a string in the format `"HH:MM:SS"`.

Return the number of seconds that have elapsed from `startTime` to `endTime`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: startTime = "01:00:00", endTime = "01:00:25"
Output: 25
Explanation: endTime is 25 seconds ahead of startTime.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: startTime = "12:34:56", endTime = "13:00:00"
Output: 1504
Explanation: endTime is 25 minutes and 4 seconds ahead of startTime, which
equals 1504 seconds.
```

### Constraints

- `startTime.length == 8`
- `endTime.length == 8`
- `startTime` and `endTime` are valid times in the format `"HH:MM:SS"`
- `00 <= HH <= 23`
- `00 <= MM <= 59`
- `00 <= SS <= 59`
- `endTime` is not earlier than `startTime`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Convert each time into the total number of seconds since `00:00:00`.

### Hint 2

The answer is the difference between the two converted values.
