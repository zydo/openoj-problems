# Zigzag Level Sum of Binary Tree

## Description

You are given the `root` of a binary tree.

Traverse the tree level by level using a zigzag pattern:

- At odd-numbered levels (1-indexed), traverse nodes from left to right.
- At even-numbered levels, traverse nodes from right to left.

While traversing a level in the specified direction, process nodes in order and
stop immediately before the first node that violates the condition:

- At odd levels: the node does not have a left child.
- At even levels: the node does not have a right child.

Only the nodes processed before this stopping condition contribute to the level
sum.

Return an integer array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the sum of the node values that
are processed at level `i + 1`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: root = [5,2,8,1,null,9,6]
Output: [5,8,0]
Explanation: At level 1, nodes are processed left to right. Node 5 is included,
thus ans[0] = 5.
At level 2, nodes are processed right to left. Node 8 is included, but node 2
lacks a right child, so processing stops, thus ans[1] = 8.
At level 3, nodes are processed left to right. The first node 1 lacks a left
child, so no nodes are included, and ans[2] = 0.
Thus, ans = [5, 8, 0].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,5,0]
Explanation: At level 1, nodes are processed left to right. Node 1 is included,
thus ans[0] = 1.
At level 2, nodes are processed right to left. Nodes 3 and 2 are included since
both have right children, thus ans[1] = 3 + 2 = 5.
At level 3, nodes are processed left to right. The first node 4 lacks a left
child, so no nodes are included, and ans[2] = 0.
Thus, ans = [1, 5, 0].
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10⁵]`.
- `-10⁵ <= Node.val <= 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use level-order traversal (BFS) to process the tree level by level

### Hint 2

Maintain a list (or queue) of nodes for the current level

### Hint 3

Alternate traversal direction using a flag (odd level vs even level)
