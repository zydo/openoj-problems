# Maximize Sum of Device Ratings

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `units` of size `m × n` where `units[i][j]`
represents the capacity of the jth unit in the ith device. Each device
contains exactly `n` units.

The rating of a device is the minimum capacity among all its units.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Choose a device `i` that has not been used as a source before.
- Remove exactly one unit from device `i` and add it to any different device.
- Then mark device `i` as used, so it cannot be chosen again as a source.

Return the maximum possible sum of the ratings of all devices after any number
of such operations.

Note:

- Devices can receive units from multiple devices, regardless of whether they
  have been selected.
- The rating of an empty device is `0`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: units = [[1,3],[2,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Select device i = 0 and transfer units[0][0] = 1 to device i = 1.
After the transfer, the ratings are:
Device 0 = [3]: rating[0] = 3
Device 1 = [2, 2, 1]: rating[1] = 1
Thus, the sum of ratings is 3 + 1 = 4.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: units = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Select device i = 1 and transfer units[1][0] = 4 to device i = 0.
After the transfer, the ratings are:
Device 0 = [1, 2, 3, 4]: rating[0] = 1
Device 1 = [5, 6]: rating[1] = 5
Thus, the sum of ratings is 1 + 5 = 6.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: units = [[5,5,5],[1,1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: No transfers increase the sum of ratings. Thus, the sum of
ratings is 5 + 1 = 6.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= m == units.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= n == units[i].length <= 10⁵`
- `m * n <= 2 * 10⁵`
- `1 <= units[i][j] <= 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

For each device, only its smallest and second-smallest capacities can affect
the answer.

### Hint 2

To improve a device’s rating, remove its smallest unit. Send all removed units
to one device, which acts as the destination for the smallest capacities.

### Hint 3

The destination device’s final rating is the smallest capacity among all
devices. To maximize the remaining contribution, choose as the destination the
device with the smallest second-smallest capacity.
