# Maximum Sum of M Non-Overlapping Subarrays II

## Description

You are given an integer array nums of length n, and three integers m, l, and
r.

Your task is to select at least one and at most m non-overlapping subarrays
from nums such that:

- Each selected subarray has a length between [l, r] (inclusive).
- The total sum of all selected subarrays is maximized.

Return the maximum total sum you can achieve.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [4,1,-5,2], m = 2, l = 1, r = 3
Output: 7
Explanation:
One optimal strategy is to:
- Select the subarray [4, 1] with sum 4 + 1 = 5 and the subarray [2] with sum
2. Both subarrays have length between [l, r].
- The total sum of these subarrays is 5 + 2 = 7, which is the maximum
achievable sum with at most m = 2 subarrays.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [1,0,3,4], m = 2, l = 1, r = 2
Output: 8
Explanation:
One optimal strategy is to:
- Select the subarray [1] with sum 1 and the subarray [3, 4] with sum 3 + 4 =
7. Both subarrays have length between [l, r].
- The total sum of these subarrays is 1 + 7 = 8, which is the maximum
achievable sum with at most m = 2 subarrays.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [-1,7,-4], m = 1, l = 2, r = 3
Output: 6
Explanation:
- Select the subarray [-1, 7] from nums which has length between [l, r].
- The total sum of this subarray is -1 + 7 = 6, which is the maximum
achievable sum with at most m = 1 subarray.
```

### Example 4

```text
Input: nums = [-3,-4,-1], m = 2, l = 1, r = 2
Output: -1
Explanation:
- All subarrays of nums have negative sums. The optimal strategy is to select
the subarray [-1], which has length between [l, r].
- The total sum of this subarray is -1, which is the maximum achievable sum
with at most m = 2 subarrays.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁵ <= nums[i] <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= m <= n`
- `1 <= l <= r <= n`

## Hints

### Hint 1

WQS Binary Search

### Hint 2

Instead of directly limiting the number of selected subarrays, assign a
penalty x for choosing each subarray.

### Hint 3

For a fixed penalty x, maximize the adjusted value sum - x * count, while also
tracking how many subarrays are chosen.

### Hint 4

For each fixed penalty, use a deque to optimize transitions over previous
split points whose distance is between l and r.

### Hint 5

As x increases, the optimal number of selected subarrays decreases, so binary
search the penalty.

### Hint 6

Convert the adjusted answer back by adding x * m.
