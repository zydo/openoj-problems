        # at the toNode node. The correction is a breadth-first sweep that
        # takes each level right to left, marking nodes seen on enqueue and
        # carrying each node's parent alongside it. toNode sits right of
        # fromNode on the same depth, so by the time fromNode is dequeued
        # its right child is already seen — and no other node can pass
        # that test, because in a tree every child is enqueued exactly
        # once, by its own parent; only the wired edge breaks that. Detach
        # the offender through the parent beside it and the tree is fixed.
