# Minimum Possible Maximum Waiting Time

## Description

You are given an integer array `demand`, where `demand[i]` is the amount of
fuel required by the ith car.

You are also given an integer array `fuel` of length 2. There are exactly two
fuel dispensers, numbered 0 and 1, where `fuel[j]` is the initial amount of
fuel available in dispenser j.

Cars are allowed to start refueling in increasing index order. Car 0 becomes
allowed at time 0, and for each i > 0, car i becomes allowed exactly when
car i - 1 starts refueling.

The refueling process follows these rules:

- Each dispenser can serve at most one car at a time.
- When a car becomes allowed, you must choose a dispenser with at least
  `demand[i]` fuel remaining. If both dispensers have enough fuel remaining,
  you may choose either of them, regardless of when they become free.
- The car waits until the chosen dispenser becomes free and starts refueling
  immediately. It cannot switch dispensers or intentionally wait after the
  chosen dispenser becomes free.
- When a car starts refueling, the remaining fuel in the chosen dispenser
  decreases by `demand[i]`, and the dispenser remains occupied for
  `demand[i]` seconds.
- Once started, refueling cannot be interrupted.
- If neither dispenser has at least `demand[i]` fuel remaining when car i
  becomes allowed, the process terminates and no further cars can be served.

The waiting time of a car is the time between when it becomes allowed to
start refueling and when it actually starts.

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum waiting time among all
served cars over all assignments that maximize the number of served cars.
If no car can be served, return -1.

### Example 1

```text
Input: demand = [6,8,4,6,5], fuel = [16,13]
Output: 6
Explanation: The following assignment serves all five cars:

Car | Becomes allowed at | Starts refueling at | Dispenser used | Remaining fuel before start (dispenser 0, dispenser 1) | Waiting time
0   | 0                  | 0                   | 0              | (16, 13)                                               | 0
1   | 0                  | 0                   | 1              | (10, 13)                                               | 0
2   | 0                  | 6                   | 0              | (10, 5)                                                | 6
3   | 6                  | 10                  | 0              | (6, 5)                                                 | 4
4   | 10                 | 10                  | 1              | (0, 5)                                                 | 0

Thus, all five cars are served, and the maximum waiting time is 6.
```

To serve all five cars, dispenser 0 must serve the cars with demands 6, 4,
and 6, while dispenser 1 must serve the cars with demands 8 and 5.
Therefore, car 2 must wait until time 6 for dispenser 0 to become free, so
no assignment serving all five cars can have a maximum waiting time less
than 6.

### Example 2

```text
Input: demand = [10,15], fuel = [12,17]
Output: 0
Explanation:
At time 0, Car 0 becomes allowed and starts refuelling using dispenser 0.
Car 1 becomes allowed at time 0 (when Car 0 starts) and immediately starts
refuelling using dispenser 1.
Both cars start without waiting, so the maximum waiting time is 0.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: demand = [10,5], fuel = [8,8]
Output: -1
Explanation:
At time 0, Car 0 becomes allowed. However, neither dispenser has enough fuel
to serve it, so the process terminates immediately.
No car is served, so the answer is -1.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= demand.length <= 50`
- `1 <= demand[i] <= 20`
- `fuel.length == 2`
- `1 <= fuel[i] <= 50`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use dynamic programming over the cars in order. For each dispenser, store its remaining fuel and the time until it becomes free, measured from when the current car becomes allowed.

### Hint 2

If the current car is assigned to a dispenser whose remaining busy time is wait, its waiting time is wait. Decrease that dispenser's fuel and set its new busy time to demand[i].

### Hint 3

Because the next car becomes allowed when the current car starts, subtract wait from the other dispenser's busy time, stopping at 0.

### Hint 4

For every state, first maximize the number of cars that can be served. Among assignments serving that maximum number, minimize the maximum waiting time encountered.
