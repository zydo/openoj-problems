# Weighted Sum of a Tree

## Description

You are given an integer array `parent` of length `n` representing a rooted
tree with nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.

The tree is rooted at node `0`, so `parent[0] = -1`. For each node `i` where
`1 <= i <= n - 1`, `parent[i]` denotes the parent of node `i`.

You are also given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, where `nums[i]`
denotes the value of node `i`.

The weight of a node `i` at depth `d` is `nums[i] * (h - d + 1)`, where `h`
is the height of the tree.

Return the sum of the weights of all nodes in the tree.

The depth of a node is the number of nodes on the path from the root to that
node, inclusive, with the root having depth 1.

The height of the tree is the maximum depth among all nodes in the tree.

### Example 1

```text
Input: parent = [-1,0,0,0,2,2], nums = [5,2,3,1,4,6]
Output: 37
Explanation: The height of the tree is 3.

Node   nums[i]   Depth (d)   Weight
0      5         1           5 * (3 - 1 + 1) = 15
1      2         2           2 * (3 - 2 + 1) = 4
2      3         2           3 * (3 - 2 + 1) = 6
3      1         2           1 * (3 - 2 + 1) = 2
4      4         3           4 * (3 - 3 + 1) = 4
5      6         3           6 * (3 - 3 + 1) = 6

The sum of all node weights is 15 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 37.
```

### Example 2

![diagram](figures/4015-2.svg)

```text
Input: parent = [-1,0,1,2], nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 20
Explanation: The height of the tree is 4.

Node   nums[i]   Depth (d)   Weight
0      1         1           1 * (4 - 1 + 1) = 4
1      2         2           2 * (4 - 2 + 1) = 6
2      3         3           3 * (4 - 3 + 1) = 6
3      4         4           4 * (4 - 4 + 1) = 4

The sum of all node weights is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `n == parent.length == nums.length`
- `parent[0] == -1`
- `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i` in `[1, n - 1]`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁶`
- The input is generated such that the array `parent` represents a valid tree
  rooted at node 0.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Build the tree and traverse it from the root to determine the depth of every node and the height h.

### Hint 2

Once h is known, calculate and sum nums[i] * (h - depth[i] + 1) for every node i.
