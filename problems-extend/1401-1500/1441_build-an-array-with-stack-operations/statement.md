# Build an Array With Stack Operations

## Description

You are given an integer array `target` and an integer `n`.

You have an empty stack with the two following operations:

- `"Push"`: pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
- `"Pop"`: removes the integer on the top of the stack.

You also have a stream of the integers in the range `[1, n]`.

Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the
bottom to the top) equal to `target`. You should follow the following
rules:

- If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from
  the stream and push it to the top of the stack.
- If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
- If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the
  top) are equal to `target`, do not read new integers from the stream
  and do not do more operations on the stack.

Return the stack operations needed to build `target` following the
mentioned rules. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them.

For a deterministic answer, the expected output is pinned to the greedy
stream simulation: read `1, 2, 3, ...` from the stream, emitting `Push`
for every number read and an extra `Pop` right after when that number is
not in `target`, and stop as soon as the last element of `target` has
been pushed — never reading past it.

### Example 1

```text
Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top
of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = [1].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,3].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top
of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2,3].
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top
of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Since the stack (from the bottom to the top) is equal to target, we stop
the stack operations. The answers that read integer 3 from the stream
are not accepted.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= target.length <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= target[i] <= n`
- `target` is strictly increasing.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use "Push" for numbers to be kept in `target` array and `["Push","Pop"]`
for numbers to be discarded.
