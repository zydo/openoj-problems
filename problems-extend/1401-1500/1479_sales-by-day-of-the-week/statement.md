# Sales by Day of the Week

## Description

Table `Orders`:

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| order_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |
| order_date  | date    |
| item_id     | int     |
| quantity    | int     |

`(order_id, item_id)` is the primary key for this table. This table
contains information on the orders placed. `order_date` is the date
`item_id` was ordered by the customer with id `customer_id`.

Table `Items`:

| Column Name   | Type    |
| ------------- | ------- |
| item_id       | int     |
| item_name     | varchar |
| item_category | varchar |

`item_id` is the primary key for this table. `item_name` is the name of
the item. `item_category` is the category of the item.

You are the business owner and would like to obtain a sales report for
category items and the day of the week.

Write a solution to report how many units in each category have been
ordered on each day of the week. The result should have one row per
category with seven columns — one per weekday, named `Monday` through
`Sunday` — holding the total number of units of that category ordered on
that weekday; weekdays with no orders contribute `0`.

Return the result table ordered by category.

Each testcase's `dataset` seeds the tables: its script inserts the
testcase's `Orders` and `Items` rows before your query runs. The result
format is in the following example.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Drive the report from `Items` with a `LEFT JOIN` onto `Orders` so that
categories without any sales still appear, and group by
`item_category`.

### Hint 2

SQLite's `STRFTIME('%w', date)` yields the weekday as `'0'` (Sunday)
through `'6'` (Saturday). Turn each weekday into its own output column
with a conditional aggregate — `SUM(CASE WHEN ... THEN quantity ELSE 0
END)` — one per day of the week.
