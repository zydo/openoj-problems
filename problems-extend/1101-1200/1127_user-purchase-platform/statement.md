The `platform` column is an ENUM (category) type of (`'desktop'`,

spent using the mobile only, the desktop only, and both mobile and desktop
together for each date.

| 2019-07-01 | both     | 200          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | both     | 0            | 0           |
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
Explanation:
On 2019-07-01, user 1 purchased using both desktop and mobile, user 2
purchased using mobile only and user 3 purchased using desktop only.
On 2019-07-02, user 2 purchased using mobile only, user 3 purchased using
desktop only and no one purchased using both platforms.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning `spend_date`,
`platform`, `total_amount`, and `total_users`.
