# Day of the Year

## Description

Given a string `date` representing a Gregorian calendar date formatted as
`YYYY-MM-DD`, return the day number of the year.

### Example 1

```text
Input: date = "2019-01-09"
Output: 9
Explanation: Given date is the 9th day of the year in 2019.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: date = "2019-02-10"
Output: 41
```

### Constraints

- `date.length == 10`
- `date[4] == date[7] == '-'`, and all other `date[i]`'s are digits
- `date` represents a calendar date between Jan 1st, 1900 and Dec 31st,
  2019.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Have an integer array of how many days there are per month. February gets
one extra day if it's a leap year. Then, we can manually count the ordinal
as `day + (number of days in months before this one)`.
