# Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its
deepest leaves.

Recall that:

- The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children.
- The depth of the root of the tree is 0. If the depth of a node is `d`, the
  depth of each of its children is `d + 1`.
- The lowest common ancestor of a set `S` of nodes is the node `A` with the
  largest depth such that every node in `S` is in the subtree with root `A`.

### Example 1

![diagram](figures/1123-1.svg)

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation: We return the node with value 2. The deepest leaf-nodes of the
tree are 7 and 4. Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the
depth of them is 2, while the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of
itself.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is
itself.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

### Follow-up

This question is the same as 865: Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest
Nodes.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Do a postorder traversal.

### Hint 2

Then, if both subtrees contain a deepest leaf, you can mark this node as the
answer (so far).

### Hint 3

The final node marked will be the correct answer.
