# Before and After Puzzle

## Description

Given a list of phrases, generate a list of Before and After puzzles.

A phrase is a string that consists of lowercase English letters and spaces
only. No space appears in the start or the end of a phrase. There are no
consecutive spaces in a phrase.

Before and After puzzles are phrases that are formed by merging two phrases
where the last word of the first phrase is the same as the first word of
the second phrase. Note that only the last word of the first phrase and the
first word of the second phrase are merged in this process.

Return the Before and After puzzles that can be formed by every two phrases
`phrases[i]` and `phrases[j]` where `i != j`. Note that the order of
matching two phrases matters, we want to consider both orders.

You should return a list of distinct strings sorted lexicographically,
after removing all duplicate phrases in the generated Before and After
puzzles.

### Example 1

```text
Input: phrases = ["writing code","code rocks"]
Output: ["writing code rocks"]
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: phrases = ["mission statement","a quick bite to eat","a chip off
the old block","chocolate bar","mission impossible","a man on a
mission","block party","eat my words","bar of soap"]
Output: ["a chip off the old block party","a man on a mission
impossible","a man on a mission statement","a quick bite to eat my
words","chocolate bar of soap"]
```

### Example 3

Input: phrases = ["a","b","a"]
Output: ["a"]
```

### Example 4

```text
Input: phrases = ["ab ba","ba ab","ab ba"]
Output: ["ab ba ab","ba ab ba"]
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= phrases.length <= 100`
- `1 <= phrases[i].length <= 100`

## Hints

### Hint 1

What if you check every pair of strings (bruteforce)?

### Hint 2

For every two strings, check if they can form a puzzle by comparing their
last and first words.
