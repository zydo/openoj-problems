# Shortest Distance to Target Color

## Description

You are given an array `colors`, in which there are three colors: 1, 2 and
3.

You are also given some queries. Each query consists of two integers `i`
and `c`, return the shortest distance between the given index `i` and the
target color `c`. If there is no solution return `-1`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: colors = [1,1,2,1,3,2,2,3,3], queries = [[1,3],[2,2],[6,1]]
Output: [3,0,3]
Explanation:
The nearest 3 from index 1 is at index 4 (3 steps away).
The nearest 2 from index 2 is at index 2 itself (0 steps away).
The nearest 1 from index 6 is at index 3 (3 steps away).
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: colors = [1,2], queries = [[0,3]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There is no 3 in the array.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= colors.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= colors[i] <= 3`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= queries[i][0] < colors.length`
- `1 <= queries[i][1] <= 3`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Greedy solution is too slow because of the limits.

### Hint 2

Can you solve this problem offline by doing some pre-processing?

### Hint 3

Calculate the answers for all indexes moving to their left and to their
right.
