# Highest Grade For Each Student

## Description

Table: `Enrollments`

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| student_id  | int  |
| course_id   | int  |
| grade       | int  |

`(student_id, course_id)` is the primary key (combination of columns with
unique values) of this table.
`grade` is never NULL.

Write a solution to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for
each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest
`course_id`.

Return the result table ordered by `student_id` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
Enrollments table:
+------------+-----------+-------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
Output:
+------------+-----------+-------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning `student_id`,
`course_id`, and `grade`.
