# Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

## Description

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in
non-decreasing order, and a character `target`. There are at least two
different characters in `letters`.

Return the smallest character in `letters` that is lexicographically greater
than `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character
in `letters`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
Output: "x"
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= letters.length <= 10⁴`
- `letters[i]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `letters` contains at least two different characters.
- `target` is a lowercase English letter.

## Hints
