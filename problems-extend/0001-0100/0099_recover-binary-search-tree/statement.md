# Recover Binary Search Tree

## Description

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of **exactly two nodes** of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

On LeetCode the function returns nothing and the judge inspects the mutated tree; here the judge observes only the return value, so recover `root` in place and return it — the returned tree is the recovered BST.

### Example 1

```text
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- `-2³¹ <= Node.val <= 2³¹ - 1`

### Follow-up

A solution using `O(n)` space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant `O(1)` space solution?
