# Best Meeting Point

## Description

Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one
friend, return the minimal total travel distance.

The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of
the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where
`distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2), the
point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of
2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal, so return 6.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: grid = [[1,1]]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- There will be at least two friends in the grid.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Try to solve it in one dimension first. How can this solution apply to the
two dimension case?
