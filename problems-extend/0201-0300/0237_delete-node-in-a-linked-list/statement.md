# Delete Node in a Linked List

## Description

There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted, `node`. You will not be given access to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

- The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
- The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
- All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
- All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

On LeetCode you are handed only the node to delete — not the head — and the judge inspects the mutated list afterwards; here lists cross the wire as value arrays, so a pointer to a middle node cannot be passed. Your function instead receives `head` and, as `node`, the value of the node to delete; delete that node in place and return `head` — the returned list is the one that remains after the deletion.

### Example 1

```text
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- The value of each node in the list is unique.
- The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node.
