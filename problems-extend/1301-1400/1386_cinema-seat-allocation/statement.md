# Cinema Seat Allocation

## Description

A cinema has `n` rows of seats, numbered from 1 to n. Each row has 10 seats,
numbered from 1 to 10.

You are given a 2D integer array `reservedSeats`, where
`reservedSeats[i] = [rowi, seati]` means that seat `seati` in row `rowi` is
already reserved.

A four-person group must be assigned to four seats in the same row. The group
can be seated in one of the following seat blocks:

- seats 2, 3, 4, 5
- seats 4, 5, 6, 7
- seats 6, 7, 8, 9

A block can be used only if none of its seats are reserved. Each seat can be
assigned to at most one group.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of four-person groups that can
be assigned.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]
Output: 4
Explanation: An optimal allocation seats four groups: each set of four
contiguous seats in one of the allowed blocks is assigned to one group, and
the reserved seats are avoided.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]
Output: 2
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]
Output: 4
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10 * n, 10^4)`
- `reservedSeats[i] == [rowi, seati]`
- `1 <= rowi <= n`
- `1 <= seati <= 10`
- All `reservedSeats[i]` are distinct.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Note you can allocate at most two four-person groups in one row.

### Hint 2

Greedily check if you can allocate seats for two groups, one group or none.

### Hint 3

Process only rows that appear in the input, for other rows you can always
allocate seats for two groups.
