# Web Crawler

## Description

Given a url `startUrl` and an interface `HtmlParser`, implement a web crawler
to crawl all links that are under the same hostname as `startUrl`.

Return all urls obtained by your web crawler in any order.

Your crawler should:

- Start from the page: `startUrl`
- Call `HtmlParser.getUrls(url)` to get all urls from a webpage of given url.
- Do not crawl the same link twice.
- Explore only the links that are under the same hostname as `startUrl`.

As shown in the example url above, the hostname is `example.org`. For
simplicity sake, you may assume all urls use http protocol without any port
specified. For example, the urls `http://leetcode.com/problems` and
`http://leetcode.com/contest` are under the same hostname, while urls
`http://example.org/test` and `http://example.com/abc` are not under the same
hostname.

The `HtmlParser` interface is defined as such:

```text
interface HtmlParser {
  // Return a list of all urls from a webpage of given url.
  public List<String> getUrls(String url);
}
```

Below are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom
testing purposes you'll have three variables `urls`, `edges` and `startUrl`.
Notice that you will only have access to `startUrl` in your code, while
`urls` and `edges` are not directly accessible to you in code.

Note: Consider the same URL with the trailing slash `"/"` as a different URL.
For example, `"http://news.yahoo.com"`, and `"http://news.yahoo.com/"` are
different urls.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[0,4]]
startUrl = "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/"
Output: [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com"
]
edges = [[0,2],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[3,0]]
startUrl = "http://news.google.com"
Output: ["http://news.google.com"]
Explanation: The startUrl links to all other pages that do not share the same hostname.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= urls.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= urls[i].length <= 300`
- `startUrl` is one of the urls.
- Hostname label must be from 1 to 63 characters long, including the dots,
  may contain only the ASCII letters from `'a'` to `'z'`, digits from `'0'`
  to `'9'` and the hyphen-minus character (`'-'`).
- The hostname may not start or end with the hyphen-minus character (`'-'`).
- You may assume there're no duplicates in url library.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use DFS/BFS to search starting from the `startUrl`. Remember to get rid of
duplicate URLs.
