# Delete Tree Nodes

## Description

A tree rooted at node 0 is given as follows:

- The number of nodes is `nodes`;
- The value of the ith node is `value[i]`;
- The parent of the ith node is `parent[i]`.

Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.

Return the number of the remaining nodes in the tree.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2],
value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-1]
Output: 2
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2],
value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-2]
Output: 6
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nodes <= 10^4`
- `parent.length == nodes`
- `0 <= parent[i] <= nodes - 1`
- `parent[0] == -1` which indicates that `0` is the root.
- `value.length == nodes`
- `-10^5 <= value[i] <= 10^5`
- The given input is guaranteed to represent a valid tree.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Traverse the tree using depth first search.

### Hint 2

Find for every node the sum of values of its sub-tree.

### Hint 3

Traverse the tree again from the root and return once you reach a node
with zero sum of values in its sub-tree.
