# The Dining Philosophers

## Description

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are
placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only
eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by
only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not
being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes
eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to
others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left
as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an
infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no
philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between
eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want
to eat or think.

The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement
the function `void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat,
putLeftFork, putRightFork)` where:

- `philosopher` is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
- `pickLeftFork` and `pickRightFork` are functions you can call to pick the
  corresponding forks of that philosopher.
- `eat` is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked
  both forks.
- `putLeftFork` and `putRightFork` are functions you can call to put down the
  corresponding forks of that philosopher.
- The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to
  eat (the function is not being called with their number).

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one
object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the
same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.

### Concurrent judging

The judge starts one real thread per meal call — `n` rounds per philosopher,
`5n` threads in all, each handed its philosopher id — all sharing one
`DiningPhilosophers` object, started in the schedule's order, which tells your
solution nothing about when each thread actually runs. Each of the five
functions appends one structured entry to a shared log: the fork actions record
`[philosopher, "left"/"right", "pick"/"put"]` and eating records
`[philosopher, "eat"]`. Many interleavings are correct, so the log is judged
order-insensitively — a correct schedule is one in which every philosopher
completes every meal, contributing exactly their `25n` entries. A solution that
deadlocks never returns and is judged as a timeout.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 1
Output: [[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[4,2,2],[1,1,1],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2],[0,1,1],[0,2,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2]]
Explanation:
n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.
The output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the
forks and the eat function, its format is:
output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)
- a is the id of a philosopher.
- b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.
- c specifies the operation: {1 : pick, 2 : put, 3 : eat}.
```
