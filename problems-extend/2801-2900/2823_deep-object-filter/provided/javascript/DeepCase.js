// Judge-provided case carrier for this problem (not editable here; the
// judge assembles this source into every submission):
//   DeepCase exposes the problem's one judged invocation: .obj is the
//   case's JSON object or array and .fn is the callable built from the
//   case's function source. drive(deepFilter) hands the submission's
//   deepFilter that pair once and records what it returned; verdict()
//   hands the recorded answer to the judge — the filtered object or
//   array verbatim, with the documented "no valid data left" outcome
//   recorded as JSON null.
