# Inversion of Object

## Description

Given an object or an array obj, return an inverted object or array
invertedObj.

The invertedObj should have the keys of obj as values and the values of obj
as keys. The indices of array should be treated as keys.

The function should handle duplicates, meaning that if there are multiple
keys in obj with the same value, the invertedObj should map the value to an
array containing all corresponding keys.

It is guaranteed that the values in obj are only strings.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only — LeetCode offers no other languages for it. Your entry point is a
class `Solution` with `run(caseRunner)`; inside it, call
`caseRunner.check(this)`. The case runner then hands your
`inversionOfObject(obj)` method the parsed structure and compares your
returned value against the expected inversion right inside the harness:
every distinct value of obj appears exactly once as a key of invertedObj,
mapped to the single originating key when unique or to an array holding all
of its originating keys in encounter order when duplicated, while an
array's indices ride along as string keys. Key order inside invertedObj
never matters.

### Example 1

```text
Input: obj = {"a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "3", "d": "4"}
Output: invertedObj = {"1": "a", "2": "b", "3": "c", "4": "d"}
Explanation: The keys from obj become the values in invertedObj, and the
values from obj become the keys in invertedObj.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: obj = {"a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "2", "d": "4"}
Output: invertedObj = {"1": "a", "2": ["b", "c"], "4": "d"}
Explanation: There are two keys in obj with the same value, the invertedObj
mapped the value to an array containing all corresponding keys.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: obj = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
Output: invertedObj = {"1": "0", "2": "1", "3": "2", "4": "3"}
Explanation: Arrays are also objects therefore array has changed to an
object and the keys (indices) from obj become the values in invertedObj,
and the values from obj become the keys in invertedObj.
```

### Constraints

- obj is a valid JSON object or array
- typeof obj[key] === "string"
- 2 <= JSON.stringify(obj).length <= 10⁵
