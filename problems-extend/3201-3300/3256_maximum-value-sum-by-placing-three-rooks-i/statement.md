# Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks I

## Description

You are given a `m x n` 2D array `board` representing a chessboard, where
`board[i][j]` represents the value of the cell `(i, j)`.

Rooks in the same row or column attack each other. You need to place three
rooks on the chessboard such that the rooks do not attack each other.

Return the maximum sum of the cell values on which the rooks are placed.

### Example 1

```text
Input: board = [[-3,1,1,1],[-3,1,-3,1],[-3,2,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can place the rooks in the cells (0, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 1) for a sum of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 15
Explanation: We can place the rooks in the cells (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2) for a sum of 1 + 5 + 9 = 15.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: board = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can place the rooks in the cells (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0) for a sum of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
```

### Constraints

- `3 <= m == board.length <= 100`
- `3 <= n == board[i].length <= 100`
- `-10⁹ <= board[i][j] <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Store the largest 3 values for each row.

### Hint 2

Select any 3 rows and brute force all combinations.
