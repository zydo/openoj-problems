# Premier League Table Ranking

## Description

Table: `TeamStats`

| Column Name    | Type    |
| -------------- | ------- |
| team_id        | int     |
| team_name      | varchar |
| matches_played | int     |
| wins           | int     |
| draws          | int     |
| losses         | int     |

`team_id` is the unique key for this table.
Each row of this table contains team id, team name, `matches_played`,
`wins`, `draws`, and `losses`.

Write a solution to calculate the points and rank for each team in the
league. Points are calculated as follows:

- 3 points for a win
- 1 point for a draw
- 0 points for a loss

Note: Teams with the same points must be assigned the same rank.

Return the result table ordered by points in descending, and then by
team_name in ascending order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the script seeds the `TeamStats`
table with that testcase's rows. The result format is in the following
example.

### Example 1

```text
Input: TeamStats table from the dataset below.
Output:
team_id  team_name        points  position
2        Liverpool        20      1
1        Manchester City  20      1
3        Chelsea          18      3
4        Arsenal          16      4
5        Tottenham        14      5
Explanation: Manchester City and Liverpool both have 20 points (6 wins *
3 points + 2 draws * 1 point), so they share position 1. Chelsea has 18
points (5 wins * 3 points + 3 draws * 1 point) and is position 3rd.
Arsenal has 16 points (4 wins * 3 points + 4 draws * 1 point) and is
position 4th. Tottenham has 14 points (3 wins * 3 points + 5 draws * 1
point) and is position 5th. The output table is ordered by points in
descending order, then by team_name in ascending order.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning four columns —
`team_id`, `team_name`, `points`, and `position` — one row per team,
ordered by points in descending order and then by team_name in ascending
order. Teams that share a point total share a position, and the next
distinct total resumes one past the number of teams already placed: two
co-leaders take positions 1 and 1, and the best team behind them takes
position 3.
