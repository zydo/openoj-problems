# Check if the Rectangle Corner Is Reachable

## Description

You are given two positive integers `xCorner` and `yCorner`, and a 2D array
`circles`, where `circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri]` denotes a circle with center at
`(xi, yi)` and radius `ri`.

There is a rectangle in the coordinate plane with its bottom left corner at
the origin and top right corner at the coordinate `(xCorner, yCorner)`. You
need to check whether there is a path from the bottom left corner to the top
right corner such that the entire path lies inside the rectangle, does not
touch or lie inside any circle, and touches the rectangle only at the two
corners.

Return `true` if such a path exists, and `false` otherwise.

### Example 1

```text
Input: xCorner = 3, yCorner = 4, circles = [[2,1,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: The black curve shows a possible path between (0, 0) and (3, 4).
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: xCorner = 3, yCorner = 3, circles = [[1,1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: No path exists from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: xCorner = 3, yCorner = 3, circles = [[2,1,1],[1,2,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: No path exists from (0, 0) to (3, 3).
```

### Example 4

```text
Input: xCorner = 4, yCorner = 4, circles = [[5,5,1]]
Output: true
```

### Constraints

- `3 <= xCorner, yCorner <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= circles.length <= 1000`
- `circles[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= xi, yi, ri <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Create a graph with n + 4 vertices.

### Hint 2

Vertices 0 to n - 1 represent the circles, vertex n represents upper edge,
vertex n + 1 represents right edge, vertex n + 2 represents lower edge, and
vertex n + 3 represents left edge.

### Hint 3

Add an edge between these vertices if they intersect or touch.

### Hint 4

Answer will be false when any of two sides left-right, left-bottom, right-top
or top-bottom are reachable using the edges.
