# Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations II

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer `k`, and an integer
`multiplier`.

You need to perform `k` operations on `nums`. In each operation:

- Find the minimum value `x` in `nums`. If there are multiple occurrences of
the minimum value, select the one that appears first.
- Replace the selected minimum value `x` with `x * multiplier`.

After the `k` operations, apply modulo `10⁹ + 7` to every value in `nums`.

Return an integer array denoting the final state of `nums` after performing
all `k` operations and then applying the modulo.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [2,1,3,5,6], k = 5, multiplier = 2
Output: [8,4,6,5,6]
Explanation:
After operation 1: [2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 2: [4, 2, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 3: [4, 4, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 4: [4, 4, 6, 5, 6]
After operation 5: [8, 4, 6, 5, 6]
After applying modulo: [8, 4, 6, 5, 6]
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [100000,2000], k = 2, multiplier = 1000000
Output: [999999307,999999993]
Explanation:
After operation 1: [100000, 2000000000]
After operation 2: [100000000000, 2000000000]
After applying modulo: [999999307, 999999993]
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁴`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= k <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= multiplier <= 10⁶`

## Hints

### Hint 1

What happens when min(nums) * multiplier > max(nums)?

### Hint 2

A cycle of operations begins.

### Hint 3

Simulate until min(nums) * multiplier > max(nums), then greedily distribute
remaining multiplications.
