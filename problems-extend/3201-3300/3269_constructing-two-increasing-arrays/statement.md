# Constructing Two Increasing Arrays

## Description

Given 2 integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` consisting only of 0 and 1,
your task is to calculate the minimum possible largest number in arrays
`nums1` and `nums2`, after doing the following.

Replace every 0 with an even positive integer and every 1 with an odd
positive integer. After replacement, both arrays should be increasing
and each integer should be used at most once.

Return the minimum possible largest number after applying the changes.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums1 = [], nums2 = [1,0,1,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After replacing, nums1 = [], and nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 5].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums1 = [0,1,0,1], nums2 = [1,0,0,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: One way to replace, having 9 as the largest element is
nums1 = [2, 3, 8, 9], and nums2 = [1, 4, 6, 7].
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums1 = [0,1,0,0,1], nums2 = [0,0,0,1]
Output: 13
Explanation: One way to replace, having 13 as the largest element is
nums1 = [2, 3, 4, 6, 7], and nums2 = [8, 10, 12, 13].
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= nums1.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums2.length <= 1000`
- `nums1 and nums2 consist only of 0 and 1.`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Think of dynamic programming.

### Hint 2

Define dp[i][j][flag] as the answer to the problem if we only consider
the first i elements of the first array, the first j elements of the
second array, and flag is either 0 or 1 indicating which array contains
the largest element.
