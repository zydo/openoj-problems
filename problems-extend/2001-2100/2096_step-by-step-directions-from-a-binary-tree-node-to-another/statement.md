# Step-By-Step Directions From a Binary Tree Node to Another

## Description

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an integer `startValue` representing the value of the start node `s`, and a different integer `destValue` representing the value of the destination node `t`.

Find the shortest path starting from node `s` and ending at node `t`. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase letters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'U'`. Each letter indicates a specific direction:

- `'L'` means to go from a node to its left child node.
- `'R'` means to go from a node to its right child node.
- `'U'` means to go from a node to its parent node.

Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node `s` to node `t`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6
Output: "UURL"
Explanation: The shortest path is: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 6.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [2,1], startValue = 2, destValue = 1
Output: "L"
Explanation: The shortest path is: 2 → 1.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `2 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= Node.val <= n`
- All the values in the tree are unique.
- `1 <= startValue, destValue <= n`
- `startValue != destValue`

## Hints

### Hint 1

The shortest path between any two nodes in a tree must pass through their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). The path will travel upwards from node `s` to the LCA and then downwards from the LCA to node `t`.

### Hint 2

Find the path strings from root → s, and root → t. Can you use these two strings to prepare the final answer?

### Hint 3

Remove the longest common prefix of the two path strings to get the path LCA → s, and LCA → t. Each step in the path of LCA → s should be reversed as `'U'`.
