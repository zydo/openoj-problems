# Two Best Non-Overlapping Events

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array of `events` where `events[i] = [startTime_i, endTime_i, value_i]`. The `i`th event starts at `startTime_i` and ends at `endTime_i`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `value_i`. You can choose at most two non-overlapping events to attend such that the sum of their values is maximized.

Return this maximum sum.

Note that the start time and end time is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends at the same time. More specifically, if you attend an event with end time `t`, the next event must start at or after `t + 1`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[2,4,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 for a sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a sum of 5.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: events = [[1,5,3],[1,5,1],[6,6,5]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Choose events 0 and 2 for a sum of 3 + 5 = 8.
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= events.length <= 10⁵`
- `events[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= startTime_i <= endTime_i <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= value_i <= 10⁶`

## Hints

### Hint 1

How can sorting the events on the basis of their start times help? How about end times?

### Hint 2

How can we quickly get the maximum score of an interval not intersecting with the interval we chose?
