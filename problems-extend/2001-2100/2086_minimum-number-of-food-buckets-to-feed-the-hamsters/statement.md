# Minimum Number of Food Buckets to Feed the Hamsters

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed string `hamsters` where `hamsters[i]` is either:

- `'H'` indicating that there is a hamster at index `i`, or
- `'.'` indicating that index `i` is empty.

You will add some number of food buckets at the empty indices in order to feed the hamsters. A hamster can be fed if there is at least one food bucket to its left or to its right. More formally, a hamster at index `i` can be fed if you place a food bucket at index `i - 1` and/or at index `i + 1`.

Return the minimum number of food buckets you should place at empty indices to feed all the hamsters or `-1` if it is impossible to feed all of them.

### Example 1

```text
Input: hamsters = "H..H"
Output: 2
Explanation: We place two food buckets at indices 1 and 2.
It can be shown that if we place only one food bucket, one of the hamsters will not be fed.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: hamsters = ".H.H."
Output: 1
Explanation: We place one food bucket at index 2.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: hamsters = ".HHH."
Output: -1
Explanation: If we place a food bucket at every empty index as shown, the hamster at index 2 will not be able to eat.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= hamsters.length <= 10⁵`
- `hamsters[i]` is either `'H'` or `'.'`.

## Hints

### Hint 1

When is it impossible to feed all the hamsters?

### Hint 2

When one or more hamsters do not have an empty space adjacent to it.

### Hint 3

Assuming all previous hamsters are fed. If there is a hamster at index `i` and you are able to place a bucket at index `i - 1` or `i + 1`, where should you put it?

### Hint 4

It is always better to place a bucket at index `i + 1` because it can feed the next hamster as well.
