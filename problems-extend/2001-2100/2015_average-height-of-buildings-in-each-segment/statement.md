# Average Height of Buildings in Each Segment

## Description

A perfectly straight street is represented by a number line. The street has
building(s) on it and is represented by a 2D integer array `buildings`, where
`buildings[i] = [startᵢ, endᵢ, heightᵢ]`. This means that there is a building
with `heightᵢ` in the half-open segment `[startᵢ, endᵢ)`.

You want to describe the heights of the buildings on the street with the
minimum number of non-overlapping segments. The street can be represented by
the 2D integer array `street`, where
`street[j] = [leftⱼ, rightⱼ, averageⱼ]` describes a half-open segment
`[leftⱼ, rightⱼ)` of the road where the average height of the buildings in the
segment is `averageⱼ`.

For example, if `buildings = [[1,5,2],[3,10,4]]`, the street could be
represented by `street = [[1,3,2],[3,5,3],[5,10,4]]` because:

- From 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of
  `2 / 1 = 2`.
- From 3 to 5, both the first and the second building are there with an average
  height of `(2 + 4) / 2 = 3`.
- From 5 to 10, there is only the second building with an average height of
  `4 / 1 = 4`.

Given `buildings`, return the 2D integer array `street` as described above,
excluding any areas of the street where there are no buildings. The segments
may mathematically be returned in any order. For deterministic judging, return
them from left to right in increasing order of their left endpoint.

The average of `n` elements is the sum of the `n` elements divided, using
integer division, by `n`.

A half-open segment `[a, b)` is the section of the number line between points
`a` and `b`, including point `a` and not including point `b`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: buildings = [[1,4,2],[3,9,4]]
Output: [[1,3,2],[3,4,3],[4,9,4]]
Explanation:
From 1 to 3, there is only the first building with an average height of 2 / 1 = 2.
From 3 to 4, both the first and the second building are there with an average height of (2+4) / 2 = 3.
From 4 to 9, there is only the second building with an average height of 4 / 1 = 4.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: buildings = [[1,3,2],[2,5,3],[2,8,3]]
Output: [[1,3,2],[3,8,3]]
Explanation:
From 1 to 2, there is only the first building with an average height of 2 / 1 = 2.
From 2 to 3, all three buildings are there with an average height of (2+3+3) / 3 = 2.
From 3 to 5, both the second and the third building are there with an average height of (3+3) / 2 = 3.
From 5 to 8, there is only the last building with an average height of 3 / 1 = 3.
The average height from 1 to 3 is the same so we can group them into one segment.
The average height from 3 to 8 is the same so we can group them into one segment.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: buildings = [[1,2,1],[5,6,1]]
Output: [[1,2,1],[5,6,1]]
Explanation:
From 1 to 2, there is only the first building with an average height of 1 / 1 = 1.
From 2 to 5, there are no buildings, so it is not included in the output.
From 5 to 6, there is only the second building with an average height of 1 / 1 = 1.
We cannot group the segments together because an empty space with no buildings separates the segments.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= buildings.length <= 10⁵`
- `buildings[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= startᵢ < endᵢ <= 10⁸`
- `1 <= heightᵢ <= 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Try sorting the start and end points of each building.

### Hint 2

The naive solution is to go through each position on the street and keep track of the sum of all the buildings at that position and the number of buildings at that position.

### Hint 3

How could we optimize that solution to pass?

### Hint 4

We don't need to go through every position, just the ones where a building starts or a building ends.
