# Maximum Strictly Increasing Cells in a Matrix

## Description

Given a 1-indexed m x n integer matrix mat, you can select any cell in the
matrix as your starting cell.

From the starting cell, you can move to any other cell in the same row or
column, but only if the value of the destination cell is strictly greater
than the value of the current cell. You can repeat this process as many
times as possible, moving from cell to cell until you can no longer make
any moves.

Your task is to find the maximum number of cells that you can visit in the
matrix by starting from some cell.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of cells that can be
visited.

### Example 1

```text
Input: mat = [[3,1],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The image shows how we can visit 2 cells starting from row
1, column 2. It can be shown that we cannot visit more than 2 cells no
matter where we start from, so the answer is 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: mat = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Since the cells must be strictly increasing, we can only
visit one cell in this example.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: mat = [[3,1,6],[-9,5,7]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The image above shows how we can visit 4 cells starting from
row 2, column 1. It can be shown that we cannot visit more than 4 cells
no matter where we start from, so the answer is 4.
```

### Constraints

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10⁵`
- `-10⁵ <= mat[i][j] <= 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

We can try to build the answer in a bottom-up fashion, starting from the
smallest values and increasing to the larger values.

### Hint 2

Going through the values in sorted order, we can store the maximum path
we have seen so far for a row/column.

### Hint 3

When we are at a cell, we check its row and column to find out the best
previous smaller value that we’ve got so far, and we use it to increment
the current value of the row and column.
