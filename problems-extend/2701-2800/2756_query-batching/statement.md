# Query Batching

## Description

Batching multiple small queries into a single large query can be a useful
optimization. Write a class `QueryBatcher` that implements this
functionality.

The constructor should accept two parameters:

- An asynchronous function `queryMultiple` which accepts an array of string
  keys `input`. It will resolve with an array of values that is the same
  length as the input array. Each index corresponds to the value associated
  with `input[i]`. You can assume the promise will never reject.
- A throttle time in milliseconds `t`.

The class has a single method.

- `async getValue(key)`. Accepts a single string key and resolves with a
  single string value. The keys passed to this function should eventually
  get passed to the `queryMultiple` function. `queryMultiple` should never
  be called consecutively within `t` milliseconds. The first time
  `getValue` is called, `queryMultiple` should immediately be called with
  that single key. If after `t` milliseconds, `getValue` had been called
  again, all the passed keys should be passed to `queryMultiple` and
  ultimately returned. You can assume every key passed to this method is
  unique.

The following diagram illustrates how the throttling algorithm works. Each
rectangle represents 100ms. The throttle time is 400ms.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only, and it is judged on a deterministic virtual clock instead of real
timers. Your entry point is a class `Solution` with
`run(driver)`, where the provided `driver` exposes:

- `driver.queryMultiple(keys)` — the asynchronous function your batcher
  must call; on the virtual clock it resolves with
  `keys.map(key => key + "!")` after its per-case delay.
- `driver.t` — the throttle time in milliseconds.
- `driver.clock` — the virtual clock: `clock.now()` returns the current
  virtual millisecond, and `clock.setTimeout(callback, delay)` schedules
  `callback` to run once, `delay` virtual milliseconds from now. Timers
  due at the same tick fire in scheduling order. Never touch global timer
  functions.
- `driver.drive(batcher)` — schedules every timeline call of the case and
  runs the whole simulation synchronously.

Construct `new QueryBatcher(driver.queryMultiple, driver.t, driver.clock)`
and pass it to `driver.drive`; the judge reads back every resolution as
`{"resolved": value, "time": virtualMs}` in resolution order.

Throttle anchoring: let `C` be the time of the most recent `queryMultiple`
call. A `getValue(key)` arriving at time `w` starts a new immediate
single-key batch when `w - C >= t` (and then `C := w`); otherwise the key
joins the pending batch, which is dispatched exactly once at time `C + t`
(and then `C := C + t`). Consecutive `queryMultiple` calls are therefore
always at least `t` milliseconds apart, measured call-to-call.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
queryMultiple = async function(keys) {
  return keys.map(key => key + '!');
}
t = 100
calls = [
 {"key": "a", "time": 10},
 {"key": "b", "time": 20},
 {"key": "c", "time": 30}
]
Output: [
 {"resolved": "a!", "time": 10},
 {"resolved": "b!", "time": 110},
 {"resolved": "c!", "time": 110}
]
Explanation:
const batcher = new QueryBatcher(queryMultiple, 100);
setTimeout(() => batcher.getValue('a'), 10); // "a!" at t=10ms
setTimeout(() => batcher.getValue('b'), 20); // "b!" at t=110ms
setTimeout(() => batcher.getValue('c'), 30); // "c!" at t=110ms

queryMultiple simply adds an "!" to the key
At t=10ms, getValue('a') is called, queryMultiple(['a']) is immediately called and the result is immediately returned.
At t=20ms, getValue('b') is called but the query is queued
At t=30ms, getValue('c') is called but the query is queued.
At t=110ms, queryMultiple(['a', 'b']) is called and the results are immediately returned.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
queryMultiple = async function(keys) {
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100));
  return keys.map(key => key + '!');
}
t = 100
calls = [
 {"key": "a", "time": 10},
 {"key": "b", "time": 20},
 {"key": "c", "time": 30}
]
Output: [
  {"resolved": "a!", "time": 110},
  {"resolved": "b!", "time": 210},
  {"resolved": "c!", "time": 210}
]
Explanation:
This example is the same as example 1 except there is a 100ms delay in queryMultiple. The results are the same except the promises resolve 100ms later.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
queryMultiple = async function(keys) {
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, keys.length * 100));
  return keys.map(key => key + '!');
}
t = 100
calls = [
  {"key": "a", "time": 10},
  {"key": "b", "time": 20},
  {"key": "c", "time": 30},
  {"key": "d", "time": 40},
  {"key": "e", "time": 250},
  {"key": "f", "time": 300}
]
Output: [
  {"resolved":"a!","time":110},
  {"resolved":"e!","time":350},
  {"resolved":"b!","time":410},
  {"resolved":"c!","time":410},
  {"resolved":"d!","time":410},
  {"resolved":"f!","time":450}
]
Explanation:
queryMultiple(['a']) is called at t=10ms, it is resolved at t=110ms
queryMultiple(['b', 'c', 'd']) is called at t=110ms, it is resolved at 410ms
queryMultiple(['e']) is called at t=250ms, it is resolved at 350ms
queryMultiple(['f']) is called at t=350ms, it is resolved at 450ms
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= t <= 1000`
- `0 <= calls.length <= 10`
- `1 <= key.length <= 100`
- All keys are unique.
