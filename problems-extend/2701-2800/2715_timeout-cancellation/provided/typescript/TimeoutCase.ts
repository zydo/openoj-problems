// Judge-provided driver for 2715 timeout-cancellation. Assembled into
// every submission by the judge ahead of the submitted code; never
// editable in the editor. This file is the hidden implementation —
// solvers see only the public API documented in the statement.
//
// Judging runs on a deterministic virtual clock, so real time and real
// timers have no influence on what is judged. drive() swaps the global
// setTimeout/clearTimeout for virtual-clock equivalents, builds a
// recorder fn from the case's fn source (every actual execution evaluates
// it over the case args and records one transcript row {time, returned}),
// hands fn/args/t to the submission's cancellable(), schedules the
// returned cancelFn at the case's cancelTimeMs, and then drains every
// scheduled timer to completion — earliest deadline first, ties broken by
// scheduling order, which is exactly how Node drains its timer phase.
// The clock pins to each fired deadline itself, so rows record their own
// instant; verdict() returns the rows in execution order.

// Ambient node globals for the assembled environment (the compile runs
// without DOM/node libs); both this driver and the submission's typed
// code may call setTimeout/clearTimeout idiomatically.
