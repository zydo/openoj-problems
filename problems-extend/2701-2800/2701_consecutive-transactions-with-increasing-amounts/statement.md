# Consecutive Transactions with Increasing Amounts

## Description

Table: `Transactions`

| Column Name     | Type |
| --------------- | ---- |
| transaction_id  | int  |
| customer_id     | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount          | int  |

`transaction_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this
table. Each row contains information about transactions that includes
unique (`customer_id`, `transaction_date`) along with the corresponding
`customer_id` and `amount`.

Write a solution to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions
with increasing amount for at least three consecutive days. Include the
`customer_id`, start date of the consecutive transactions period and the end
date of the consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive
transactions by a customer.

Return the result table ordered by `customer_id`, `consecutive_start`,
`consecutive_end` in ascending order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Transactions`
table with that testcase's rows. The result format is shown in the following
example.

Transactions table:

| 11             | 105         | 2023-05-12       | 250    |
| 12             | 105         | 2023-05-13       | 260    |
| 13             | 105         | 2023-05-14       | 270    |
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
| customer_id | consecutive_start | consecutive_end |
+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
| 101         | 2023-05-01        | 2023-05-03      |
| 105         | 2023-05-01        | 2023-05-04      |
| 105         | 2023-05-12        | 2023-05-14      |

Explanation:
- customer_id 101 has made consecutive transactions with increasing amounts from May 1st, 2023, to May 3rd, 2023
- customer_id 102 does not have any consecutive transactions for at least 3 days.
- customer_id 105 has two sets of consecutive transactions: from May 1st, 2023, to May 4th, 2023, and from May 12th, 2023, to May 14th, 2023.
customer_id is sorted in ascending order.
```

The result rows are each customer's maximal periods of strictly rising daily
amounts over a run of consecutive calendar days — an interior day that skips
a calendar date or fails to exceed the previous day's amount ends its period,
and only periods spanning at least three days are reported. Since a run of
four qualifying days yields one row covering all four rather than every
three-day window inside it, a customer may contribute several rows whenever
several separate periods qualify. Write your solution as a single `SELECT`
query returning three columns — `customer_id`, `consecutive_start`, and
`consecutive_end`, in that order — with the rows in the exact ordering
described above.
