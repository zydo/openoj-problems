// Promise.all subscribes to both inputs the moment it is called, so the
// two settlements stay concurrent: a slow first promise never delays
// attachment of the second one's handler, and the combined callback fires
// right after the slower fulfillment hop. The destructured pair is added
// in exactly one place, and the returned promise resolves with that sum —
// its own timing is irrelevant to the problem.
