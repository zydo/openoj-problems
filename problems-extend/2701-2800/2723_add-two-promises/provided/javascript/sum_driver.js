//
// The case's two promise specs become real promises on a deterministic
// virtual clock: each resolves with its value once its stated delay
// elapses, ticks fire in (due time, scheduling order), and drive() pumps
// them with a microtask checkpoint between fires so every settlement's
// full promise cascade drains before the next one fires. Real time and
// real timers have no influence on what is judged; only the resolved sum
// is.
