# Find the Closest Marked Node

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n` which is the number of nodes of a
0-indexed directed weighted graph and a 0-indexed 2D array `edges` where
`edges[i] = [uᵢ, vᵢ, wᵢ]` indicates that there is an edge from node `uᵢ` to
node `vᵢ` with weight `wᵢ`.

You are also given a node `s` and a node array `marked`; your task is to find
the minimum distance from `s` to any of the nodes in `marked`.

Return an integer denoting the minimum distance from `s` to any node in
`marked` or `-1` if there are no paths from `s` to any of the marked nodes.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,3],[2,3,2],[0,3,4]], s = 0, marked = [2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There is one path from node 0 (the green node) to node 2 (a red node), which is 0->1->2, and has a distance of 1 + 3 = 4.
There are two paths from node 0 to node 3 (a red node), which are 0->1->2->3 and 0->3, the first one has a distance of 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 and the second one has a distance of 4.
The minimum of them is 4.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,2,4],[1,3,1],[2,3,3],[3,4,2]], s = 1, marked = [0,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are no paths from node 1 (the green node) to node 0 (a red node).
There is one path from node 1 to node 4 (a red node), which is 1->3->4, and has a distance of 1 + 2 = 3.
So the answer is 3.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,3],[2,3,2]], s = 3, marked = [0,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no paths from node 3 (the green node) to any of the marked nodes (the red nodes), so the answer is -1.
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 500`
- `1 <= edges.length <= 10⁴`
- `edges[i].length = 3`
- `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1`
- `1 <= edges[i][2] <= 10⁶`
- `1 <= marked.length <= n - 1`
- `0 <= s, marked[i] <= n - 1`
- `s != marked[i]`
- `marked[i] != marked[j]` for every `i != j`
- The graph might have repeated edges.
- The graph is generated such that it has no self-loops.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Find the distance from s to all nodes.

### Hint 2

You can use Dijkstra to find them.

### Hint 3

Find the minimum distance between marked nodes.
