Working in fractional hours invites precision bugs, and searching skip
subsets is exponential. Both go away with one DP over integer units of
`dist * speed`: keep `dp[j]`, the smallest accumulated travel time
(measured as distance, since speed is constant) after finishing road
`i` having used exactly `j` skips, with every taken rest already rounded
up to the next whole hour.

## Skip-count DP on scaled times

For each road with length `d`, a state at time `t` arrives at `t + d`.
Taking the rest is free but rounds the arrival up to the next multiple
of `speed` (a whole hour); skipping keeps `t + d` exactly but consumes
one skip. So from `dp[j] = t`: rest updates `dp[j]` with
`ceil((t + d) / speed) * speed`, and skip updates `dp[j + 1]` with
`t + d`. The last road offers neither choice — no rest follows it — so
its arrival is simply `dp[j] + d`. The answer is the smallest `j` whose
final value is at most `hoursBefore * speed`; if none qualifies, return
`-1`.

Because ceiling is monotone, keeping only the minimum time per skip
count is safe: any other reachable time at the same count rounds to a
value at least as large on every future road. All arithmetic stays
integral — values are bounded by `hoursBefore * speed + max(dist)`-ish
magnitudes well inside 64 bits.

**Complexity:** `O(n^2)` time for `n` roads, `O(n)` space.
