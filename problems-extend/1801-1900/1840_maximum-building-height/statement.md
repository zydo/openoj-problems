# Maximum Building Height

## Description

You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be
built in a line and are labeled from 1 to `n`.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

- The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
- The height of the first building must be 0.
- The height difference between any two adjacent buildings cannot exceed 1.

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of
specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array
`restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [id_i, max_height_i]` indicates
that building `id_i` must have a height less than or equal to
`max_height_i`.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear at most once in
`restrictions`, and building 1 will not be in `restrictions`.

Return the maximum possible height of the tallest building.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[2,1],[4,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,1,2], and the tallest building has a height of 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 6, restrictions = []
Output: 5
Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,4,5], and the tallest building has a height of 5.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: n = 10, restrictions = [[5,3],[2,5],[7,4],[10,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,3], and the tallest building has a height of 5.
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 10⁹`
- `0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 10⁵)`
- `2 <= id_i <= n`
- `id_i` is unique.
- `0 <= max_height_i <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Is it possible to find the max height if given the height range of a particular building?

### Hint 2

You can find the height range of a restricted building by doing 2 passes from the left and right.
