# Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging

## Description

You have `n` packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package
in each box. There are `m` suppliers that each produce boxes of
different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box
if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box.

The package sizes are given as an integer array `packages`, where
`packages[i]` is the size of the `i`th package. The suppliers are given
as a 2D integer array `boxes`, where `boxes[j]` is an array of box sizes
that the `j`th supplier produces.

You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that
the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we
define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The
total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.

- For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes `[2,3,5]` and the
  supplier offers boxes of sizes `[4,8]`, you can fit the packages of
  size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5
  into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) +
  (8-5) = 6.

Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier
optimally, or `-1` if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside
boxes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10⁹ + 7`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[4,8],[2,8]]
Output: 6
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the first supplier, using two
size-4 boxes and one size-8 box. The total waste is (4-2) + (4-3) +
(8-5) = 6.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no box that the package of size 5 can fit in.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: packages = [3,5,8,10,11,12],
       boxes = [[12],[11,9],[10,5,14]]
Output: 9
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the third supplier, using two
size-5 boxes, two size-10 boxes, and two size-14 boxes. The total waste
is (5-3) + (5-5) + (10-8) + (10-10) + (14-11) + (14-12) = 9.
```

### Constraints

- `n == packages.length`
- `m == boxes.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= m <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= packages[i] <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= boxes[j].length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= boxes[j][k] <= 10⁵`
- `sum(boxes[j].length) <= 10⁵`
- The elements in `boxes[j]` are distinct.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Given a fixed size box, is there a way to quickly query which packages
(i.e., count and sizes) should end up in that box size?

### Hint 2

Do we have to order the boxes a certain way to allow us to answer the
query quickly?
