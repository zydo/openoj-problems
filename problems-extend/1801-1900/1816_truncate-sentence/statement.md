# Truncate Sentence

## Description

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no
leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and
lowercase English letters (no punctuation).

For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, and `"hello world hello world"` are
all sentences.

You are given a sentence `s` and an integer `k`. You want to truncate `s`
such that it contains only the first `k` words. Return `s` after truncating
it.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
Output: "Hello how are you"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you", "Contestant"].
The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"].
Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "What is the solution to this problem", k = 4
Output: "What is the solution"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["What", "is" "the", "solution", "to", "this", "problem"].
The first 4 words are ["What", "is", "the", "solution"].
Hence, you should return "What is the solution".
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: s = "chopper is not a tanuki", k = 5
Output: "chopper is not a tanuki"
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of words in s]`.
- `s` consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
- The words in `s` are separated by a single space.
- There are no leading or trailing spaces.

## Hints

### Hint 1

It's easier to solve this problem on an array of strings so parse the string
to an array of words

### Hint 2

After return the first k words as a sentence
