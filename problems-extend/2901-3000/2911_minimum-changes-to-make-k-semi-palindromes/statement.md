# Minimum Changes to Make K Semi-palindromes

## Description

Given a string s and an integer k, partition s into k substrings such that
the letter changes needed to make each substring a semi-palindrome are
minimized.

Return the minimum number of letter changes required.

A semi-palindrome is a special type of string that can be divided into
palindromes based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a
semi-palindrome:

- Choose a positive divisor d of the string's length. d can range from 1 up
  to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length 1, it
  does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only
  divisor is its length, which is not allowed.
- For a given divisor d, divide the string into groups where each group
  contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of
  length d. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at
  positions 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, and so on; the second group includes
  characters at positions 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d, etc.
- The string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a
  palindrome.

Consider the string "abcabc":

- The length of "abcabc" is 6. Valid divisors are 1, 2, and 3.
- For d = 1: The entire string "abcabc" forms one group. Not a palindrome.
- For d = 2:
    - Group 1 (positions 1, 3, 5): "acb"
    - Group 2 (positions 2, 4, 6): "bac"
    - Neither group forms a palindrome.
- For d = 3:
    - Group 1 (positions 1, 4): "aa"
    - Group 2 (positions 2, 5): "bb"
    - Group 3 (positions 3, 6): "cc"
    - All groups form palindromes. Therefore, "abcabc" is a semi-palindrome.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "abcac", k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: Divide s into "ab" and "cac". "cac" is already
semi-palindrome. Change "ab" to "aa", it becomes semi-palindrome with
d = 1.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "abcdef", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Divide s into substrings "abc" and "def". Each needs one
change to become semi-palindrome.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: s = "aabbaa", k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Divide s into substrings "aa", "bb" and "aa". All are
already semi-palindromes.
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= s.length <= 200`
- `1 <= k <= s.length / 2`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum count of letter changes needed to split the
suffix of string s starting from s[i] into j valid parts.

### Hint 2

We have dp[i][j] = min(dp[x + 1][j - 1] + v[i][x]). Here v[i][x] is the
minimum number of letter changes to change substring s[i..x] into
semi-palindrome.

### Hint 3

v[i][j] can be calculated separately by brute-force. We can create a table
of v[i][j] independently to improve the complexity. Also note that
semi-palindrome’s length is at least 2.
