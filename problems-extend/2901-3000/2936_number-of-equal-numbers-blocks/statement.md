# Number of Equal Numbers Blocks

## Description

This is an **interactive** problem.

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers, nums. The following property
holds for nums:

- All occurrences of a value are adjacent. In other words, if there are two
  indices `i < j` such that `nums[i] == nums[j]`, then for every index `k`
  that `i < k < j`, `nums[k] == nums[i]`.

Since nums is a very large array, you are given an instance of the BigArray
class which has the following functions:

- `at(index)` — Returns the value of nums[i].
- `size()` — Returns nums.length.

Let's partition the array into maximal blocks such that each block contains
equal values. Return the number of these blocks.

Note that if you want to test your solution using a custom test, behavior
for tests with nums.length > 10 is undefined.

**Note (OpenOJ):** your `countBlocks` method receives the `BigArray` as its
only argument. A test case describes nums by its maximal blocks — each
block as a `[value, count]` pair — and the judge builds the `BigArray` from
that description, so arrays far too large to list directly are fair game.
`at` takes a 64-bit index and `size` returns a 64-bit length.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one block here which is the whole array (because
all numbers are equal) and that is: [3,3,3,3,3]. So the answer would be 1.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,9,9,9,2,10,10]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 blocks here:
Block number 1: [1,1,1]
Block number 2: [3]
Block number 3: [9,9,9]
Block number 4: [2]
Block number 5: [10,10]
So the answer would be 5.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: 7
Explanation: Since all numbers are distinct, there are 7 blocks here and
each element representing one block. So the answer would be 7.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10¹⁵`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`
- The input is generated such that all equal values are adjacent.
- The sum of the elements of nums is at most 10¹⁵.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Start from the beginning of the array nums.at(0).

### Hint 2

Do a binary search on the last index last such that nums.at(0) == nums.at(last).

### Hint 3

Continue this process until you get to the end of the array (nums.size()).
