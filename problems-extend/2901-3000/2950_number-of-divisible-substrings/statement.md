# Number of Divisible Substrings

## Description

Each character of the English alphabet has been mapped to a digit as shown
below.

- `a`, `b` map to `1`
- `c`, `d`, `e` map to `2`
- `f`, `g`, `h` map to `3`
- `i`, `j`, `k` map to `4`
- `l`, `m`, `n` map to `5`
- `o`, `p`, `q` map to `6`
- `r`, `s`, `t`, `u` map to `7`
- `v`, `w`, `x` map to `8`
- `y`, `z` map to `9`

A string is divisible if the sum of the mapped values of its characters is
divisible by its length.

Given a string s, return the number of divisible substrings of s.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a
string.

```text
Substring  Mapped      Sum  Length  Divisible?
a          1             1       1  Yes
s          7             7       1  Yes
d          2             2       1  Yes
f          3             3       1  Yes
as         1, 7          8       2  Yes
sd         7, 2          9       2  No
df         2, 3          5       2  No
asd        1, 7, 2      10       3  No
sdf        7, 2, 3      12       3  Yes
asdf       1, 7, 2, 3   13       4  No

Input: word = "asdf"
Output: 6
Explanation: The table above contains the details about every substring of
word, and we can see that 6 of them are divisible.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: word = "bdh"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 divisible substrings are: "b", "d", "h", "bdh".
It can be shown that there are no other substrings of word that are
divisible.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: word = "abcd"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 divisible substrings are: "a", "b", "c", "d", "ab",
"cd".
It can be shown that there are no other substrings of word that are
divisible.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= word.length <= 2000`
- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Iterate over all substrings in O(n * n).

### Hint 2

For each substring, try to calculate the sum of the mapped values in O(1).

### Hint 3

To do the above, use a partial sum array.
