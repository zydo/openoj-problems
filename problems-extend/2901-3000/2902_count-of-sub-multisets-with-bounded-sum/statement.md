# Count of Sub-Multisets With Bounded Sum

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed array nums of non-negative integers, and two
integers l and r.

Return the count of sub-multisets within nums where the sum of elements
in each subset falls within the inclusive range of [l, r].

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10⁹ + 7.

A sub-multiset is an unordered collection of elements of the array in
which a given value x can occur 0, 1, ..., occ[x] times, where occ[x] is
the number of occurrences of x in the array.

Note that:

- Two sub-multisets are the same if sorting both sub-multisets results
  in identical multisets.
- The sum of an empty multiset is 0.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3], l = 6, r = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The only subset of nums that has a sum of 6 is {1, 2, 3}.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [2,1,4,2,7], l = 1, r = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: The subsets of nums that have a sum within the range [1, 5]
are {1}, {2}, {4}, {2, 2}, {1, 2}, {1, 4}, and {1, 2, 2}.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,2], l = 3, r = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The subsets of nums that have a sum within the range [3, 5]
are {3}, {5}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 3}, and
{1, 2, 2}.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `Sum of nums does not exceed 2 * 10⁴`
- `0 <= l <= r <= 2 * 10⁴`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Since the sum of nums is at most 20000, the number of distinct elements
of nums is 200.

### Hint 2

Let dp[x] be the number of submultisets of nums with sum x.

### Hint 3

The answer to the problem is dp[l] + dp[l+1] + … + dp[r].

### Hint 4

Use coin change dp to transition between states.
