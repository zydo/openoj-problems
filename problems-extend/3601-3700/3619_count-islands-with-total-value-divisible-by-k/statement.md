# Count Islands With Total Value Divisible by K

## Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` and a positive integer `k`. An island
is a group of positive integers (representing land) that are 4-directionally
connected (horizontally or vertically).

The total value of an island is the sum of the values of all cells in the
island.

Return the number of islands with a total value divisible by `k`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: grid = [[0,2,1,0,0],[0,5,0,0,5],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,4,7,0],[0,2,0,0,8]], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The grid contains four islands. The islands highlighted in blue
have a total value that is divisible by 5, while the islands highlighted in
red do not.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: grid = [[3,0,3,0], [0,3,0,3], [3,0,3,0]], k = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: The grid contains six islands, each with a total value that is
divisible by 3.
```

### Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10⁵`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10⁶`
- `1 <= k <= 10⁶`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use a BFS/DFS to find connected components.
