# Minimum Number of Primes to Sum to Target

## Description

You are given two integers `n` and `m`.

You have to select a multiset of prime numbers from the first `m` prime
numbers such that the sum of the selected primes is exactly `n`. You may use
each prime number multiple times.

Return the minimum number of prime numbers needed to sum up to `n`, or `-1`
if it is not possible.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 10, m = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The first 2 primes are [2, 3]. The sum 10 can be formed as 2 + 2 + 3 + 3, requiring 4 primes.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 15, m = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 5 primes are [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]. The sum 15 can be formed as 5 + 5 + 5, requiring 3 primes.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: n = 7, m = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The first 6 primes are [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]. The sum 7 can be formed directly by prime 7, requiring only 1 prime.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m <= 1000`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Can we use dynamic programming?

### Hint 2

Generate the first `m` prime numbers.

### Hint 3

Let `dp[i]` represent the minimum number of prime numbers that sum up to
`i`. Use the generated prime numbers for the transition.
