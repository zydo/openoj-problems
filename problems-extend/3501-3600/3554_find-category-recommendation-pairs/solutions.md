# Solutions — Find Category Recommendation Pairs

The grain of the question is the (customer, category) relationship, so the
query builds it first: `ProductPurchases` joins `ProductInfo` on
`product_id` to translate every purchase row into a (user, category) pair,
and `SELECT DISTINCT` collapses them — a customer who bought three
different Books contributes one Books pair, and `quantity` never enters
the calculation at all. Self-joining that deduplicated set on `user_id`
with the ordering condition `a.category < b.category` then emits exactly
one row per (customer, unordered category pair); the strict inequality
both forbids pairing a category with itself and fixes each pair's
orientation, so `COUNT(*)` after `GROUP BY category1, category2` is by
construction the number of distinct customers sharing both categories.

The reportability threshold and the presentation are one filtering pass:
`WHERE customer_count >= 3` keeps only pairs with at least three shared
customers, and the outer `ORDER BY customer_count DESC, category1,
category2` implements the stated tie-break ladder. The judge compares
result rows as an unordered multiset, so the explicit ordering is fidelity
to the statement rather than a correctness requirement. With `U` purchase
rows deduplicated into `P` (user, category) pairs, the self-join does at
most `SUM(k_u²)` work over per-user category counts `k_u`, and the
aggregation is linear in the join output.

**Complexity:** `O(U + P²)` time, `O(P)` space.
