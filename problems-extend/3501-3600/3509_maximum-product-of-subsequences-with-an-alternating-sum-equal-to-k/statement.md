# Maximum Product of Subsequences With an Alternating Sum Equal to K

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers, `k` and `limit`.
Your task is to find a non-empty subsequence of `nums` that:

- Has an alternating sum equal to `k`.
- Maximizes the product of all its numbers without the product exceeding
  `limit`.

Return the product of the numbers in such a subsequence. If no subsequence
satisfies the requirements, return `-1`.

The alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the
elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 2, limit = 10
Output: 6
Explanation:
The subsequences with an alternating sum of 2 are:

[1, 2, 3]
    Alternating Sum: 1 - 2 + 3 = 2
    Product: 1 * 2 * 3 = 6

[2]
    Alternating Sum: 2
    Product: 2

The maximum product within the limit is 6.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [0,2,3], k = -5, limit = 12
Output: -1
Explanation:
A subsequence with an alternating sum of exactly -5 does not exist.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,3,3], k = 0, limit = 9
Output: 9
Explanation:
The subsequences with an alternating sum of 0 are:

[2, 2]
    Alternating Sum: 2 - 2 = 0
    Product: 2 * 2 = 4

[3, 3]
    Alternating Sum: 3 - 3 = 0
    Product: 3 * 3 = 9

[2, 2, 3, 3]
    Alternating Sum: 2 - 2 + 3 - 3 = 0
    Product: 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36

The subsequence [2, 2, 3, 3] has the greatest product with an alternating
sum equal to k, but 36 > 9. The next greatest product is 9, which is within
the limit.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 150`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 12`
- `-10⁵ <= k <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= limit <= 5000`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use dynamic programming.

### Hint 2

Save all possible products with a particular sum.

### Hint 3

Handle the case where a subsequence has a product of 0 and an alternating
sum of `k`.
