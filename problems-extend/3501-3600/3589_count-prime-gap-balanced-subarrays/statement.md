# Count Prime-Gap Balanced Subarrays

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

A subarray is called prime-gap balanced if:

- It contains at least two prime numbers, and
- The difference between the maximum and minimum prime numbers in that
  subarray is less than or equal to `k`.

Return the count of prime-gap balanced subarrays in `nums`.

Note:

- A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an
  array.
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with only two factors,
  1 and itself.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Prime-gap balanced subarrays are:

    [2,3]: contains two primes (2 and 3), max - min = 3 - 2 = 1 <= k.
    [1,2,3]: contains two primes (2 and 3), max - min = 3 - 2 = 1 <= k.

Thus, the answer is 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [2,3,5,7], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Prime-gap balanced subarrays are:

    [2,3]: contains two primes (2 and 3), max - min = 3 - 2 = 1 <= k.
    [2,3,5]: contains three primes (2, 3, and 5), max - min = 5 - 2 = 3 <= k.
    [3,5]: contains two primes (3 and 5), max - min = 5 - 3 = 2 <= k.
    [5,7]: contains two primes (5 and 7), max - min = 7 - 5 = 2 <= k.

Thus, the answer is 4.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `0 <= k <= 5 * 10⁴`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Sieve and extract primes.

### Hint 2

Build a sparse-table for O(1) max–min queries.

### Hint 3

For each prime, binary‐search the furthest valid partner.

### Hint 4

Count subarrays via left/right gap multiplication.
