# Remove All Ones With Row and Column Flips II

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix `grid`.

In one operation, you can choose any `i` and `j` that meet the following
conditions:

- `0 <= i < m`
- `0 <= j < n`
- `grid[i][j] == 1`

and change the values of all cells in row `i` and column `j` to zero.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to remove all 1's from
`grid`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
In the first operation, change all cell values of row 1 and column 1 to
zero.
In the second operation, change all cell values of row 0 and column 0 to
zero.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
In the first operation, change all cell values of row 1 and column 0 to
zero.
In the second operation, change all cell values of row 2 and column 1 to
zero.
Note that we cannot perform an operation using row 1 and column 1 because
grid[1][1] != 1.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: grid = [[0,0],[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no 1's to remove so return 0.
```

### Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 15`
- `1 <= m * n <= 15`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Hints

### Hint 1

With the given constraints, could a brute force solution pass?

### Hint 2

What would a brute force solution look like?

### Hint 3

We can try every single possibility of choosing to do an operation on a
cell with a 1 or choosing to ignore it.
