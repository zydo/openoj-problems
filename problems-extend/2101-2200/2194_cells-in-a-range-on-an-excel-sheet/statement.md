# Cells in a Range on an Excel Sheet

## Description

A cell `(r, c)` of an excel sheet is represented as a string
`"<col><row>"` where:

- `<col>` denotes the column number `c` of the cell. It is represented by
  alphabetical letters.
  For example, the 1st column is denoted by `'A'`, the 2nd by `'B'`, the
  3rd by `'C'`, and so on.
- `<row>` is the row number `r` of the cell. The rth row is represented
  by the integer `r`.

You are given a string `s` in the format
`"<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>"`, where `<col1>` represents the column `c1`,
`<row1>` represents the row `r1`, `<col2>` represents the column `c2`,
and `<row2>` represents the row `r2`, such that `r1 <= r2` and
`c1 <= c2`.

Return the list of cells `(x, y)` such that `r1 <= x <= r2` and
`c1 <= y <= c2`. The cells should be represented as strings in the format
mentioned above and be sorted in non-decreasing order first by columns
and then by rows.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "K1:L2"
Output: ["K1","K2","L1","L2"]
Explanation:
The list contains every cell in the rectangle from K1 to L2, ordered by
column first and then by row.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "A1:F1"
Output: ["A1","B1","C1","D1","E1","F1"]
Explanation: The range spans columns A through F on row 1.
```

### Constraints

- `s.length == 5`
- `'A' <= s[0] <= s[3] <= 'Z'`
- `'1' <= s[1] <= s[4] <= '9'`
- `s` consists of uppercase English letters, digits and ':'.

## Hints

### Hint 1

From the given string, find the corresponding rows and columns.

### Hint 2

Iterate through the columns in ascending order and for each column,
iterate through the rows in ascending order to obtain the required cells
in sorted order.
