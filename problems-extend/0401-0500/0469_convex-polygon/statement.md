# Convex Polygon

## Description

You are given an array of points on the X-Y plane `points` where
`points[i] = [xi, yi]`. The points form a polygon when joined sequentially.

Return `true` if this polygon is convex and `false` otherwise.

You may assume that the polygon formed by given points is always a **simple
polygon**. In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each
vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.

### Example 1

```text
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,5],[5,5],[5,0]]
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]
Output: false
```

### Constraints

- `3 <= points.length <= 10⁴`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-10⁴ <= xi, yi <= 10⁴`
- All the given points are unique.
