# Matrix Diagonal Sum

## Description

Given a square matrix `mat`, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.

Only include the sum of all the elements on the primary diagonal and all
the elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary
diagonal.

### Example 1

```text
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 25
Explanation: Diagonals sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
Notice that element mat[1][1] = 5 is counted only once.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1]]
Output: 8
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: mat = [[5]]
Output: 5
```

### Constraints

- `n == mat.length == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100`

## Hints

### Hint 1

There will be overlap of elements in the primary and secondary diagonals
if and only if the length of the matrix is odd, which is at the center.
