# Count Good Triplets

## Description

Given an array of integers `arr` and three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`,
count the number of good triplets.

A triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` is good if all of the following hold:

- `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length`
- `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
- `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
- `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`

Here `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Return the number of good triplets.

### Example 1

```text
Input: arr = [3,0,1,1,9,7], a = 7, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good triplets: [(3,0,1), (3,0,1), (3,1,1), (0,1,1)].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,3], a = 0, b = 0, c = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: No triplet satisfies all conditions.
```

### Constraints

- `3 <= arr.length <= 100`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= a, b, c <= 1000`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Notice that the constraints are small enough for a brute-force solution
to pass.

### Hint 2

Loop through all triplets, and count the ones that are good.
