# Sequential Grid Path Cover

## Description

You are given a 2D array `grid` of size m x n, and an integer `k`. There are
k cells in `grid` containing the values from 1 to k exactly once, and the
rest of the cells have a value 0.

You can start at any cell, and move from a cell to its neighbors (up, down,
left, or right). You must find a path in `grid` which:

- Visits each cell in `grid` exactly once.
- Visits the cells with values from 1 to k in order.

Return a 2D array `result` of size (m * n) x 2, where `result[i] = [xi, yi]`
represents the ith cell visited in the path. If there are multiple such
paths, you may return any one.

If no such path exists, return an empty array.

### Example 1

![diagram](figures/3565-1.svg)

```text
Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,2]], k = 2
Output: [[0,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,2],[0,2],[0,1]]
Explanation: The path visits all six cells exactly once, reaching the cell
holding 1 before the cell holding 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: grid = [[1,0,4],[3,0,2]], k = 4
Output: []
Explanation: There is no possible path that satisfies the conditions.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= m == grid.length <= 5`
- `1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 5`
- `1 <= k <= m * n`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= k`
- `grid` contains all integers between 1 and k exactly once.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use recursive backtracking.
