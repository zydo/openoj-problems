# Subarrays with K Different Integers

## Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of good
subarrays of `nums`.

A good array is an array where the number of different integers in that array
is exactly `k`.

For example, `[1,2,3,1,2]` has 3 different integers: 1, 2, and 3.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Subarrays formed with exactly 2 different integers:
[1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,1], [2,1,2], [1,2,1,2].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,4], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Subarrays formed with exactly 3 different integers:
[1,2,1,3], [2,1,3], [1,3,4].
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= nums[i], k <= nums.length`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Try generating all possible subarrays and checking the number of different
integers in each, incrementing the count as you go — correct, but quadratic.

### Hint 2

How about using a map to store the count of each integer in the window?

### Hint 3

Think about the sliding window and two-pointer approach.
