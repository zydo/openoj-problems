# Minimize XOR

## Description

Given two positive integers num1 and num2, find the positive integer x such
that:

- x has the same number of set bits as num2, and
- The value x XOR num1 is minimal.

Note that XOR is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the integer x. The test cases are generated such that x is uniquely
determined.

The number of set bits of an integer is the number of 1's in its binary
representation.

### Example 1

```text
Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 3 = 0 is minimal.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: num1 = 1, num2 = 12
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0001 and 1100, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 1 = 2 is minimal.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= num1, num2 <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

To arrive at a small xor, try to turn off some bits from num1

### Hint 2

If there are still left bits to set, try to set them from the least significant bit
