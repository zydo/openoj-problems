# Optimal Partition of String

## Description

Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more substrings such
that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter
appears in a single substring more than once.

Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a
partition.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "ssssss"
Output: 6
Explanation:
The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10⁵`
- `s` consists of only English lowercase letters.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Try to come up with a greedy approach.

### Hint 2

From left to right, extend every substring in the partition as much as
possible.
