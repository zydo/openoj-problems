# String Compression

## Description

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following
algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating
characters in `chars`:

- If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` should not be returned separately, but instead,
be stored in the input character array `chars`. Note that group lengths
that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the
array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

Note: the characters in the array beyond the returned length do not matter
and should be ignored.

On LeetCode the judge also inspects the rewritten array; here the judge
observes only the returned length, so compress `chars` in place and return
the new length.

### Example 1

```text
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: 6
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to
"a2b2c3". After modifying the input array in-place, the first 6 characters
of chars should be ["a","2","b","2","c","3"].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it is
a single character. After modifying the input array in-place, the first
character of chars should be ["a"].
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: 4
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to
"ab12". After modifying the input array in-place, the first 4 characters of
chars should be ["a","b","1","2"].
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
- `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter,
  digit, or symbol.

## Hints

### Hint 1

How do you know if you are at the end of a consecutive group of characters?
