# K Items With the Maximum Sum

## Description

There is a bag that consists of items, each item has a number 1, 0, or -1
written on it.

You are given four non-negative integers numOnes, numZeros, numNegOnes,
and k.

The bag initially contains:

numOnes items with 1s written on them.
numZeroes items with 0s written on them.
numNegOnes items with -1s written on them.

We want to pick exactly k items among the available items. Return the
maximum possible sum of numbers written on the items.

### Example 1

```text
Input: numOnes = 3, numZeros = 2, numNegOnes = 0, k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We have a bag of items with numbers written on them {1, 1, 1, 0, 0}. We take 2 items with 1 written on them and get a sum in a total of 2.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum possible sum.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: numOnes = 3, numZeros = 2, numNegOnes = 0, k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: We have a bag of items with numbers written on them {1, 1, 1, 0, 0}. We take 3 items with 1 written on them, and 1 item with 0 written on it, and get a sum in a total of 3.
It can be proven that 3 is the maximum possible sum.
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= numOnes, numZeros, numNegOnes <= 50`
- `0 <= k <= numOnes + numZeros + numNegOnes`

## Hints

### Hint 1

It is always optimal to take items with the number 1 written on them as
much as possible.

### Hint 2

If k > numOnes, after taking all items with the number 1, it is always
optimal to take items with the number 0 written on them as much as
possible.

### Hint 3

If k > numOnes + numZeroes we are forced to take k - numOnes - numZeroes
-1s.
