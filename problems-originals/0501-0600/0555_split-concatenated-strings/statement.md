# Split Concatenated Strings

## Description

You are given an array of strings `strs`. You could concatenate these strings
together into a loop, where for each string, you could choose to reverse it or
not. Among all the possible loops, return the lexicographically largest string
after cutting the loop, which will make the looped string into a regular one.

Specifically, to find the lexicographically largest string, you need to
experience two phases:

1. Concatenate all the strings into a loop, where you can reverse some strings
   or not and connect them in the same order as given.
2. Cut and make one breakpoint in any place of the loop, which will make the
   looped string into a regular one starting from the character at the
   cutpoint.

And your job is to find the lexicographically largest one among all the
possible regular strings.

### Example 1

```text
Input: strs = ["abc","xyz"]
Output: "zyxcba"
Explanation: You can get the looped string "-abcxyz-", "-abczyx-", "-cbaxyz-",
"-cbazyx-", where '-' represents the looped status. The answer string came
from the fourth looped one, where you could cut from the middle character 'a'
and get "zyxcba".
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: strs = ["abc"]
Output: "cba"
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= strs.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= strs[i].length <= 1000`
- `1 <= sum(strs[i].length) <= 1000`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
