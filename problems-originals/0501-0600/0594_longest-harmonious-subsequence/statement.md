# Longest Harmonious Subsequence

## Description

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its
maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of its longest harmonious
subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequences are [1,2], [2,3], and [3,4],
all of which have a length of 2.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No harmonic subsequence exists.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10⁴`
- `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`
