# Interval Cancellation

## Description

Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and an interval time t,
return a cancel function cancelFn.

After a delay of cancelTimeMs, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be
invoked.

setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

The function fn should be called with args immediately and then called again
every t milliseconds until cancelFn is called at cancelTimeMs ms.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only — LeetCode offers no other languages for it. It is judged on a
deterministic virtual clock instead of real timers: your submission declares
`function cancellable(fn, args, t)` plus a class Solution whose `run` method
hands your function to the bundle-provided driver:
`intervalCase.drive(cancellable)`. During `drive` the driver replaces the
global `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` and `setInterval`/`clearInterval` with
virtual-clock equivalents, constructs your `cancellable(fn, args, t)` (fn
records the transcript: every actual execution pushes one row
`{"time": <virtual execution time>, "returned": <the value fn returned>}`),
schedules the returned cancelFn at the case's `cancelTimeMs`, then drains every
scheduled timer to completion — earliest deadline first, ties broken by
scheduling order, exactly as Node drains its timer queue. The interval is
scheduled before the cancel timeout, so an interval tick at the same deadline
runs first. That recorded transcript is the judged answer shown as `Output`
below. Real elapsed time has no influence on anything. Call fn immediately,
then use the timer APIs for later calls and cancellation; do not synchronously
simulate future ticks.

### Example 1

```text
Input: fn = (x) => x * 2, args = [4], t = 35
cancelTimeMs = 190
Output:
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 35, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 70, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 105, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 140, "returned": 8},
   {"time": 175, "returned": 8}
]
Explanation:
const cancelTimeMs = 190;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x) => x * 2, [4], 35);
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs);

Every 35ms, fn(4) is called. Until t=190ms, then it is cancelled.
1st fn call is at 0ms. fn(4) returns 8.
2nd fn call is at 35ms. fn(4) returns 8.
3rd fn call is at 70ms. fn(4) returns 8.
4th fn call is at 105ms. fn(4) returns 8.
5th fn call is at 140ms. fn(4) returns 8.
6th fn call is at 175ms. fn(4) returns 8.
Cancelled at 190ms
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: fn = (x1, x2) => (x1 * x2), args = [2, 5], t = 30
cancelTimeMs = 165
Output:
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 30, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 60, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 90, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 120, "returned": 10},
   {"time": 150, "returned": 10}
]
Explanation:
const cancelTimeMs = 165;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x1, x2) => (x1 * x2), [2, 5], 30)
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

Every 30ms, fn(2, 5) is called. Until t=165ms, then it is cancelled.
1st fn call is at 0ms
2nd fn call is at 30ms
3rd fn call is at 60ms
4th fn call is at 90ms
5th fn call is at 120ms
6th fn call is at 150ms
Cancelled at 165ms
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: fn = (x1, x2, x3) => (x1 + x2 + x3), args = [5, 1, 3], t = 50
cancelTimeMs = 180
Output:
[
   {"time": 0, "returned": 9},
   {"time": 50, "returned": 9},
   {"time": 100, "returned": 9},
   {"time": 150, "returned": 9}
]
Explanation:
const cancelTimeMs = 180;
const cancelFn = cancellable((x1, x2, x3) => (x1 + x2 + x3), [5, 1, 3], 50)
setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

Every 50ms, fn(5, 1, 3) is called. Until t=180ms, then it is cancelled.
1st fn call is at 0ms
2nd fn call is at 50ms
3rd fn call is at 100ms
4th fn call is at 150ms
Cancelled at 180ms
```

### Constraints

- `fn` is a function
- `args` is a valid JSON array
- `1 <= args.length <= 10`
- `30 <= t <= 100`
- `10 <= cancelTimeMs <= 500`
