# Join Two Arrays by ID

## Description

Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, return a new array joinedArray. All the
objects in each of the two inputs arrays will contain an id field that has
an integer value.

joinedArray is an array formed by merging arr1 and arr2 based on their id
key. The length of joinedArray should be the length of unique values of
id. The returned array should be sorted in ascending order based on the
id key.

If a given id exists in one array but not the other, the single object
with that id should be included in the result array without modification.

If two objects share an id, their properties should be merged into a
single object:

- If a key only exists in one object, that single key-value pair should be
  included in the object.
- If a key is included in both objects, the value in the object from arr2
  should override the value from arr1.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only — LeetCode offers no other languages for it. Your entry point is a
class `Solution` with `run(caseRunner)`; inside it, call
`caseRunner.check(this)`. The case runner then hands your
`joinTwoArrays(arr1, arr2)` method fresh copies of both arrays and
compares your returned array against the expected join right inside the
harness, element by element: the outer array must follow the ascending id
order above, while key order inside each merged object never matters, and
any JSON value — `null`, booleans, numbers, strings, or nested containers,
which are replaced whole rather than merged — may sit behind any key.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
arr1 = [
    {"id": 1, "x": 1},
    {"id": 2, "x": 9}
],
arr2 = [
    {"id": 3, "x": 5}
]
Output:
[
    {"id": 1, "x": 1},
    {"id": 2, "x": 9},
    {"id": 3, "x": 5}
]
Explanation: There are no duplicate ids so arr1 is simply concatenated
with arr2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
arr1 = [
    {"id": 1, "x": 2, "y": 3},
    {"id": 2, "x": 3, "y": 6}
],
arr2 = [
    {"id": 2, "x": 10, "y": 20},
    {"id": 3, "x": 0, "y": 0}
]
Output:
[
    {"id": 1, "x": 2, "y": 3},
    {"id": 2, "x": 10, "y": 20},
    {"id": 3, "x": 0, "y": 0}
]
Explanation: The two objects with id=1 and id=3 are included in the result
array without modifiction. The two objects with id=2 are merged together.
The keys from arr2 override the values in arr1.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
arr1 = [
    {"id": 1, "b": {"b": 94},"v": [4, 3], "y": 48}
],
arr2 = [
    {"id": 1, "b": {"c": 84}, "v": [1, 3]}
]
Output:
[
    {"id": 1, "b": {"c": 84}, "v": [1, 3], "y": 48}
]
Explanation: The two objects with id=1 are merged together. For the keys
"b" and "v" the values from arr2 are used. Since the key "y" only exists
in arr1, that value is taken form arr1.
```

### Constraints

- arr1 and arr2 are valid JSON arrays
- Each object in arr1 and arr2 has a unique integer id key
- 2 <= JSON.stringify(arr1).length <= 10⁶
- 2 <= JSON.stringify(arr2).length <= 10⁶
