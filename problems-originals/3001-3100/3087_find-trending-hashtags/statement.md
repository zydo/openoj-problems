# Find Trending Hashtags

## Description

Table: `Tweets`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| user_id     | int     |
| tweet_id    | int     |
| tweet_date  | date    |
| tweet       | varchar |

`tweet_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains user_id, tweet_id, tweet_date and tweet.

Write a solution to find the top 3 trending hashtags in February 2024. Each
tweet only contains one hashtag.

Return the result table orderd by count of hashtag, hashtag in descending
order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Tweets` table
with that testcase's rows. The result format is in the following example.

Explanation:
#HappyDay: Appeared in tweet IDs 13, 14, and 17, with a total count of 3 mentions.
#TechLife: Appeared in tweet IDs 16 and 18, with a total count of 2 mentions.
#WorkLife: Appeared in tweet ID 15, with a total count of 1 mention.
Note: Output table is sorted in descending order by hashtag_count and hashtag respectively.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning two columns —
`hashtag`, the tag exactly as it appears in the tweet starting at its `#`
and running to the next space or the end of the tweet, and `hashtag_count`,
how many February 2024 tweets carry it — with at most three rows: the top
three hashtags, ordered by `hashtag_count` descending and then `hashtag`
descending. Return the result table in that order.
