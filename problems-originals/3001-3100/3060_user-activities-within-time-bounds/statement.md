# User Activities within Time Bounds

## Description

Table: `Sessions`

| Column Name   | Type     |
| ------------- | -------- |
| user_id       | int      |
| session_start | datetime |
| session_end   | datetime |
| session_id    | int      |
| session_type  | enum     |

`session_id` is column of unique values for this table.
`session_type` is an ENUM (category) type of (Viewer, Streamer).
This table contains user id, session start, session end, session id and
session type.

Write a solution to find the the users who have had at least two session
of the same type (either 'Viewer' or 'Streamer') with a maximum gap of
12 hours between sessions.

Return the result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Sessions`
table with that testcase's rows. The result format is in the following
example.

+---------+---------------------+---------------------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 102     |
| 103     |
+---------+
Explanation:
- User ID 101 will not be included in the final output as they do not
have any two sessions of the same session type.
- User ID 102 will be included in the final output as they had two
viewer sessions with session IDs 3 and 4, respectively, and the time gap
between them was less than 12 hours.
- User ID 103 participated in two viewer sessions with a gap of less
than 12 hours between them, identified by session IDs 10 and 11.
Therefore, user 103 will be included in the final output.
Output table is ordered by user_id in increasing order.
```

The gap between two sessions of the same type runs from the moment the
earlier one ends to the moment the later one begins, taking "earlier"
by `session_start`; a later session that starts before the earlier one
ends overlaps it and sits within any positive bound. Twelve hours is
the maximum allowed gap: a pair whose later session starts exactly
twelve hours after the earlier one ends still qualifies, while anything
later does not. Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query
returning one column — `user_id` — with one row for every user holding
such a pair of same-type sessions, ordered by `user_id` ascending.
