# Isomorphic Strings

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced
to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
character, but a character may map to itself.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Explanation: The strings s and t can be made identical by mapping 'e' to 'a'
and mapping 'g' to 'd'.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "f11", t = "b23"
Output: false
Explanation: The strings s and t can not be made identical as '1' needs to be
mapped to both '2' and '3'.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.
