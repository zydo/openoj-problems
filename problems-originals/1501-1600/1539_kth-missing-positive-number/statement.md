# Kth Missing Positive Number

## Description

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in strictly increasing
order, and an integer `k`, return the `k`th positive integer that is
missing from this array.

### Example 1

```text
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...].
The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd
missing positive integer is 6.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 1000`
- `arr[i] < arr[j]` for `1 <= i < j <= arr.length`

### Follow up

Could you solve this problem in less than `O(n)` complexity?

## Hints

### Hint 1

Keep track of how many positive numbers are missing as you scan the
array.
