# Generalized Abbreviation

## Description

A word's generalized abbreviation can be constructed by taking any number of
non-overlapping and non-adjacent substrings and replacing them with their
respective lengths.

For example, "abcde" can be abbreviated into:

- "a3e" ("bcd" turned into "3")
- "1bcd1" ("a" and "e" both turned into "1")
- "5" ("abcde" turned into "5")
- "abcde" (no substrings replaced)

However, these abbreviations are invalid:

- "23" ("ab" turned into "2" and "cde" turned into "3") is invalid as the
  substrings chosen are adjacent.
- "22de" ("ab" turned into "2" and "bc" turned into "2") is invalid as the
  substrings chosen overlap.

Given a string `word`, return a list of all the possible generalized
abbreviations of `word`.

For a deterministic answer, this judge pins the emission order of the
canonical backtracking: scanning `word` left to right, at each position
first abbreviate the character — extending the running count — then keep
it, flushing the pending count immediately before the letter, and emit the
abbreviation once the scan passes the end of the word. Example 1 lists the
abbreviations in exactly this order.

### Example 1

```text
Input: word = "word"
Output: ["4","3d","2r1","2rd","1o2","1o1d","1or1","1ord","w3","w2d","w1r1","w1rd","wo2","wo1d","wor1","word"]
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: word = "a"
Output: ["1","a"]
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `word` consists of only lowercase English letters.
