# Count Days Without Meetings

## Description

You are given a positive integer days representing the total number of days
an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given
a 2D array meetings of size n where, meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]
represents the starting and ending days of meeting i (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no
meetings are scheduled.

Note: The meetings may overlap.

### Example 1

```text
Input: days = 10, meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: days = 5, meetings = [[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is no meeting scheduled on the 5th day.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: days = 6, meetings = [[1,6]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Meetings are scheduled for all working days.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= days <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= meetings.length <= 10⁵`
- `meetings[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= meetings[i][0] <= meetings[i][1] <= days`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Merge the overlapping meetings and sort the new meetings timings.

### Hint 2

Return the sum of difference between the end time of a meeting and the start time of the next meeting for all adjacent pairs.
