# Find Trending Hashtags II

## Description

Table: `Tweets`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| user_id     | int     |
| tweet_id    | int     |
| tweet_date  | date    |
| tweet       | varchar |

tweet_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains user_id, tweet_id, tweet_date and tweet.
It is guaranteed that all tweet_date are valid dates in February 2024.

Write a solution to find the top 3 trending hashtags in February 2024.
Every tweet may contain several hashtags.

Return the result table ordered by count of hashtag, hashtag in descending
order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Tweets` table
with that testcase's rows. The result format is in the following example.

#HappyDay: Appeared in tweet IDs 13, 14, and 17, with a total count of 3 mentions.
#TechLife: Appeared in tweet IDs 16 and 18, with a total count of 2 mentions.
#WorkLife: Appeared in tweet ID 15, with a total count of 1 mention.

```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning two columns —
`hashtag`, a tag exactly as it appears from its `#` up to the next space or
the end of the tweet, and `count`, how many times that tag occurs across all
the February tweets (every occurrence in every tweet counts) — and returning
at most three rows: the top three hashtags, ordered by `count` descending
and then by `hashtag` descending. Return the result table in that order.
