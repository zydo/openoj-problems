# Palindrome Number

## Description

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

### Example 1

```text
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Constraints

- `-2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1`

### Follow-up

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Hints

### Hint 1

Beware of overflow when you reverse the integer.
