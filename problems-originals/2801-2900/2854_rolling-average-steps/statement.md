# Rolling Average Steps

## Description

Table: `Steps`

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| user_id     | int  |
| steps_count | int  |
| steps_date  | date |

(user_id, steps_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains user_id, steps_count, and steps_date.

Write a solution to calculate 3-day rolling averages of steps for each user.

We calculate the n-day rolling average this way:

For each day, we calculate the average of n consecutive days of step counts
ending on that day if available, otherwise, n-day rolling average is not
defined for it.

Output the user_id, steps_date, and rolling average. Round the rolling
average to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by user_id, steps_date in ascending order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Steps` table
with that testcase's rows. The result format is in the following example.

| 6       | 303         | 2021-09-05 |

Output:
+---------+------------+-----------------+
| user_id | steps_date | rolling_average |
+---------+------------+-----------------+
| 1       | 2021-09-06 | 535.33          |
| 1       | 2021-09-07 | 595.67          |
| 2       | 2021-09-08 | 284.67          |
| 3       | 2021-09-09 | 505.67          |
| 3       | 2021-09-10 | 674.67          |

Explanation:
- For user id 1, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-06 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (395 + 499 + 712) / 3 = 535.33.
- For user id 1, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-07 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (499 + 712 + 576) / 3 = 595.67.
- For user id 2, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-08 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (153 + 171 + 530) / 3 = 284.67.
- For user id 3, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-09 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (120 + 557 + 840) / 3 = 505.67.
- For user id 3, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-10 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (557 + 840 + 627) / 3 = 674.67.
- For user id 4 and 5, the calculation of the rolling average is not viable as there is insufficient data for the consecutive three days. Output table ordered by user_id and steps_date in ascending order.
```

Write your solution as a single SELECT query returning one row per
qualifying day with three columns: `user_id`, `steps_date`, and
`rolling_average`. A day qualifies exactly when that same user has a row on
each of the two calendar days immediately before `steps_date`, so a window
never crosses a missing day — "consecutive" means consecutive calendar
dates, and gaps or single-day holes simply leave those days out of the
output. The rolling average is the mean of the three step counts rounded to
two decimal places. Return the rows ordered by ascending `user_id`, then
ascending `steps_date`.
