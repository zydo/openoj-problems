# Highest Salaries Difference

## Description

Table: `Salaries`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| emp_name    | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| salary      | int     |

(`emp_name`, `department`) is the primary key (combination of unique values)
for this table.
Each row of this table contains emp_name, department and salary. There will
be at least one entry for the engineering and marketing departments.

Write a solution to calculate the difference between the highest salaries in
the marketing and engineering department. Output the absolute difference in
salaries.

Return the result table.

Each testcase's `dataset` seeds the table: its script inserts the testcase's
`Salaries` rows before your query runs.

The result format is in the following example.
