# Count of Substrings Containing Every Vowel and K Consonants II

## Description

You are given a string word and a non-negative integer k.

Return the total number of substrings of word that contain every vowel ('a',
'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') at least once and exactly k consonants.

### Example 1

```text
Input: word = "aeioqq", k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no substring with every vowel.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: word = "aeiou", k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: The only substring with every vowel and zero consonants is
word[0..4], which is "aeiou".
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: word = "ieaouqqieaouqq", k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings with every vowel and one consonant are:

	word[0..5], which is "ieaouq".
	word[6..11], which is "qieaou".
	word[7..12], which is "ieaouq".
```

### Constraints

- `5 <= word.length <= 2 * 10⁵`
- word consists only of lowercase English letters.
- `0 <= k <= word.length - 5`

## Hints

### Hint 1

We can use sliding window and binary search.

### Hint 2

For each index r, find the maximum l such that both conditions are satisfied
using binary search.
