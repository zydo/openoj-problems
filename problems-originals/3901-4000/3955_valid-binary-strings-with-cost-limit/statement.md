# Valid Binary Strings With Cost Limit

## Description

You are given two integers n and k.

The cost of a binary string s is defined as the sum of all indices i
(0-based) such that s[i] == '1'.

A binary string is considered valid if:

- It does not contain two consecutive '1' characters.
- Its cost is less than or equal to k.

Return a list of all valid binary strings of length n in any order.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: ["000","010","100"]
Explanation: The binary strings of length 3 without consecutive '1'
characters are:
"000" : cost = 0
"100" : cost = 0
"010" : cost = 1
"001" : cost = 2
"101" : cost = 0 + 2 = 2
Among these, the strings with cost less than or equal to k = 1 are "000",
"010" and "100".
Thus, the valid strings are ["000", "010", "100"].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 1, k = 0
Output: ["0","1"]
Explanation: The valid binary strings of length 1 are "0" and "1".
Thus the answer is ["0", "1"].
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 12`
- `0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Build the string from left to right using backtracking.

### Hint 2

At index i, you can place '1' only if the previous character is not '1' and
the new cost does not exceed k.

### Hint 3

Whenever the string reaches length n, add it to the answer.
