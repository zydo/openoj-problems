# Maximum Bitwise XOR After Rearrangement

## Description

You are given two binary strings `s` and `t`, each of length n.

You may rearrange the characters of `t` in any order, but `s` must remain
unchanged.

Return a binary string of length n representing the maximum integer value
obtainable by taking the bitwise XOR of `s` and rearranged `t`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "101", t = "011"
Output: "110"
Explanation: One optimal rearrangement of t is "011". The bitwise XOR of s
and rearranged t is "101" XOR "011" = "110", which is the maximum possible.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "0110", t = "1110"
Output: "1101"
Explanation: One optimal rearrangement of t is "1011". The bitwise XOR of s
and rearranged t is "0110" XOR "1011" = "1101", which is the maximum
possible.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: s = "0101", t = "1001"
Output: "1111"
Explanation: One optimal rearrangement of t is "1010". The bitwise XOR of s
and rearranged t is "0101" XOR "1010" = "1111", which is the maximum
possible.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n == s.length == t.length <= 2 * 10⁵`
- `s[i]` and `t[i]` are either '0' or '1'.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Count how many '0' and '1' characters exist in t.

### Hint 2

To maximize XOR, try to place opposite bits: match '1' in s with '0' from t,
and '0' in s with '1'.

### Hint 3

Greedily build the result from left to right, using available counts while
maximizing each XOR bit.
