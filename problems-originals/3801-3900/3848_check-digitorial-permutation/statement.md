# Check Digitorial Permutation

## Description

You are given an integer `n`.

A number is called digitorial if the sum of the factorials of its digits is
equal to the number itself.

Determine whether any permutation of `n` (including the original order) forms
a digitorial number.

Return true if such a permutation exists, otherwise return false.

Note: The factorial of a non-negative integer `x`, denoted as `x!`, is the
product of all positive integers less than or equal to `x`, and `0! = 1`. A
permutation is a rearrangement of all the digits of a number that does not
start with zero. Any arrangement starting with zero is invalid.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 145
Output: true
Explanation: The number 145 itself is digitorial since 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24
+ 120 = 145. Thus, the answer is true.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 10
Output: false
Explanation: 10 is not digitorial since 1! + 0! = 2 is not equal to 10, and
the permutation "01" is invalid because it starts with zero.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Precompute the factorial of digits 0 to 9 and compute the sum of factorials
of the digits.

### Hint 2

Check whether the digits of this sum can be formed using exactly the digits
of `n` (no leading zero allowed).
