# Market Analysis III

## Description

Table: `Users`

| Column Name    | Type    |
| -------------- | ------- |
| seller_id      | int     |
| join_date      | date    |
| favorite_brand | varchar |

`seller_id` is column of unique values for this table. This table contains
seller id, join date, and favorite brand of sellers.

Table: `Items`

| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| item_id     | int     |
| item_brand  | varchar |

`item_id` is the column of unique values for this table. This table
contains item id and item brand.

Table: `Orders`

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| order_id    | int  |
| order_date  | date |
| item_id     | int  |
| seller_id   | int  |

`order_id` is the column of unique values for this table. `item_id` is a
foreign key to the Items table. `seller_id` is a foreign key to the Users
table. This table contains order id, order date, item id and seller id.

Write a solution to find the top seller who has sold the highest number of
unique items with a different brand than their favorite brand. If there
are multiple sellers with the same highest count, return all of them.

Return the result table ordered by seller_id in ascending order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Users`,
`Items`, and `Orders` tables with that testcase's rows. The result format
is in the following example.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
Users table:
+-----------+------------+----------------+
| seller_id | join_date  | favorite_brand |
+-----------+------------+----------------+
| 1         | 2019-01-01 | Lenovo         |
| 2         | 2019-02-09 | Samsung        |
| 3         | 2019-01-19 | LG             |
+-----------+------------+----------------+
Orders table:
+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
| order_id | order_date | item_id | seller_id |
+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
| 1        | 2019-08-01 | 4       | 2         |
| 2        | 2019-08-02 | 2       | 3         |
| 3        | 2019-08-03 | 3       | 3         |
| 4        | 2019-08-04 | 1       | 2         |
| 5        | 2019-08-04 | 4       | 2         |
+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
Items table:
+---------+------------+
| item_id | item_brand |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | Samsung    |
| 2       | Lenovo     |
| 3       | LG         |
| 4       | HP         |
+---------+------------+
Output:
+-----------+-----------+
| seller_id | num_items |
+-----------+-----------+
| 2         | 1         |
| 3         | 1         |
+-----------+-----------+
Explanation:
- The user with seller_id 2 has sold three items, but only two of them are
not marked as a favorite. We will include a unique count of 1 because both
of these items are identical.
- The user with seller_id 3 has sold two items, but only one of them is
not marked as a favorite. We will include just that non-favorite item in
our count.
Since seller_ids 2 and 3 have the same count of one item each, they both
will be displayed in the output.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning two columns —
`seller_id` and `num_items` — one row per winning seller, sorted by
`seller_id` in ascending order. A seller whose every order matches their
favorite brand never appears in the output.
