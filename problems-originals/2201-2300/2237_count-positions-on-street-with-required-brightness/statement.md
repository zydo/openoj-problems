# Count Positions on Street With Required Brightness

## Description

You are given an integer `n`. A perfectly straight street is represented by a
number line ranging from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a 2D integer array `lights` representing the street lamp(s) on
the street. Each `lights[i] = [position_i, range_i]` indicates that there is a
street lamp at position `position_i` that lights up the area from
`[max(0, position_i - range_i), min(n - 1, position_i + range_i)]`
(inclusive).

The brightness of a position `p` is defined as the number of street lamps that
light up the position `p`.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `requirement` of size `n` where
`requirement[i]` is the minimum brightness of the `i-th` position on the
street.

Return the number of positions `i` on the street between `0` and `n - 1` that
have a brightness of at least `requirement[i]`.

### Example 1

![diagram](figures/2237-1.svg)

```
Input: n = 5, lights = [[0,1],[2,1],[3,2]], requirement = [0,2,1,4,1]
Output: 4
Explanation:
- The first street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 0 - 1), min(5 - 1, 0 + 1)] = [0, 1] (inclusive).
- The second street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 2 - 1), min(5 - 1, 2 + 1)] = [1, 3] (inclusive).
- The third street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 3 - 2), min(5 - 1, 3 + 2)] = [1, 4] (inclusive).

- Position 0 is covered by the first street lamp. It is covered by 1 street lamp which is greater than requirement[0].
- Position 1 is covered by the first, second, and third street lamps. It is covered by 3 street lamps which is greater than requirement[1].
- Position 2 is covered by the second and third street lamps. It is covered by 2 street lamps which is greater than requirement[2].
- Position 3 is covered by the second and third street lamps. It is covered by 2 street lamps which is less than requirement[3].
- Position 4 is covered by the third street lamp. It is covered by 1 street lamp which is equal to requirement[4].

Positions 0, 1, 2, and 4 meet the requirement so we return 4.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: n = 1, lights = [[0,1]], requirement = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- The first street lamp lights up the area from [max(0, 0 - 1), min(1 - 1, 0 + 1)] = [0, 0] (inclusive).
- Position 0 is covered by the first street lamp. It is covered by 1 street lamp which is less than requirement[0].
- We return 0 because no position meets their brightness requirement.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= lights.length <= 10⁵`
- `0 <= position_i < n`
- `0 <= range_i <= 10⁵`
- `requirement.length == n`
- `0 <= requirement[i] <= 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

How can we find the brightness at every position on the street?

### Hint 2

We can use a hash table to store the change in brightness from the previous position to the current position.
