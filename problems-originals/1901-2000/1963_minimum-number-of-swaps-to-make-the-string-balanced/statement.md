# Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed string `s` of even length `n`. The string consists of
exactly `n / 2` opening brackets `'['` and `n / 2` closing brackets `']'`.

A string is called balanced if and only if:

- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as `AB`, where both `A` and `B` are balanced strings, or
- It can be written as `[C]`, where `C` is a balanced string.

You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.

Return the minimum number of swaps to make `s` balanced.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "][]["
Output: 1
Explanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
The resulting string is "[[]]".
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: s = "[]"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already balanced.
```

### Constraints

- `n == s.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10⁶`
- `n` is even.
- `s[i]` is either `'['` or `']'`.
- The number of opening brackets `'['` equals `n / 2`, and the number of
  closing brackets `']'` equals `n / 2`.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Iterate over the string and keep track of the number of opening and closing
brackets on each step.

### Hint 2

If the number of closing brackets is ever larger, you need to make a swap.

### Hint 3

Swap it with the opening bracket closest to the end of `s`.
