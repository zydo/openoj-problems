# Maximum of Minimum Values in All Subarrays

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`. You are asked to solve
`n` queries, one for each integer `i` in the range `0 <= i < n`.

To solve the `i^th` query:

1. Find the minimum value in each possible subarray of size `i + 1` of the
   array `nums`.
2. Find the maximum of those minimum values. This maximum is the answer to
   the query.

Return a 0-indexed integer array `ans` of size `n` such that `ans[i]` is the
answer to the `i^th` query.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements in an array.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [0,1,2,4]
Output: [4,2,1,0]
Explanation:
i=0:
- The subarrays of size 1 are [0], [1], [2], [4]. The minimum values are 0, 1, 2, 4.
- The maximum of the minimum values is 4.
i=1:
- The subarrays of size 2 are [0,1], [1,2], [2,4]. The minimum values are 0, 1, 2.
- The maximum of the minimum values is 2.
i=2:
- The subarrays of size 3 are [0,1,2], [1,2,4]. The minimum values are 0, 1.
- The maximum of the minimum values is 1.
i=3:
- There is one subarray of size 4, which is [0,1,2,4]. The minimum value is 0.
- There is only one value, so the maximum is 0.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [10,20,50,10]
Output: [50,20,10,10]
Explanation:
i=0:
- The subarrays of size 1 are [10], [20], [50], [10]. The minimum values are 10, 20, 50, 10.
- The maximum of the minimum values is 50.
i=1:
- The subarrays of size 2 are [10,20], [20,50], [50,10]. The minimum values are 10, 20, 10.
- The maximum of the minimum values is 20.
i=2:
- The subarrays of size 3 are [10,20,50], [20,50,10]. The minimum values are 10, 10.
- The maximum of the minimum values is 10.
i=3:
- There is one subarray of size 4, which is [10,20,50,10]. The minimum value is 10.
- There is only one value, so the maximum is 10.
```

### Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Imagine the array is empty, and each element arrives at its index one by one, starting with the smallest element.

### Hint 2

For each arriving element nums[i], calculate L and R, the indices of the first smaller elements on the left and on the right respectively.

### Hint 3

The answers for all query lengths from 1 to R - L + 1 are at least this element, because it is the minimum of some window of that length.

### Hint 4

Finish by taking a suffix maximum over the per-length answers.
