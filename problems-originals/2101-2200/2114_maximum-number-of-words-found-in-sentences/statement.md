# Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences

## Description

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single sentence.

Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

### Example 1

```text
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation:
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
Output: 3
Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words.
In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= sentences.length <= 100`
- `1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100`
- `sentences[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters and `' '` only.
- `sentences[i]` does not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `sentences[i]` are separated by a single space.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Process each sentence separately and count the number of words by looking for the number of space characters in the sentence and adding it by 1.
