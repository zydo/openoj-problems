# Find the Derangement of an Array

## Description

In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements
of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

You are given an integer `n`. There is originally an array consisting of `n`
integers from `1` to `n` in ascending order, return the number of derangements
it can generate. Since the answer may be huge, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1]
and [3,1,2].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^6`
