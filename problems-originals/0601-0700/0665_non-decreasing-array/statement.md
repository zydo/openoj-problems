# Non-decreasing Array

## Description

Given an array `nums` with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could
become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array to be non-decreasing if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` holds for
every `i` (0-based) such that `0 <= i <= n - 2`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one
element.
```

### Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁴`
- `-10⁵ <= nums[i] <= 10⁵`
