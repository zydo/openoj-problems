# Immediate Food Delivery III

## Description

Table: `Delivery`

| Column Name                 | Type |
| --------------------------- | ---- |
| delivery_id                 | int  |
| customer_id                 | int  |
| order_date                  | date |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date |

`delivery_id` is the column with unique values of this table.
Each row contains information about food delivery to a customer that makes an
order at some date and specifies a preferred delivery date (on the order date
or after it).

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then
the order is called immediate, otherwise, it is scheduled.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders on each unique
order_date, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by order_date in ascending order.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `Delivery` table
with that testcase's rows. The result format is in the following example.

Delivery table:

| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-01                  |

| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-03 | 2019-08-03                  |
| 8           | 1           | 2019-08-03 | 2019-08-03                  |
| 9           | 5           | 2019-08-04 | 2019-08-08                  |
| 10          | 2           | 2019-08-04 | 2019-08-18                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
Output:
+------------+----------------------+
| order_date | immediate_percentage |
+------------+----------------------+
| 2019-08-01 | 66.67                |
| 2019-08-02 | 66.67                |
| 2019-08-03 | 100.00               |
| 2019-08-04 | 0.00                 |
+------------+----------------------+
Explanation:
- On 2019-08-01 there were three orders, out of those, two were immediate and one was scheduled. So, immediate percentage for that date was 66.67.
- On 2019-08-02 there were three orders, out of those, two were immediate and one was scheduled. So, immediate percentage for that date was 66.67.
- On 2019-08-03 there were two orders, both were immediate. So, the immediate percentage for that date was 100.00.
- On 2019-08-04 there were two orders, both were scheduled. So, the immediate percentage for that date was 0.00.
order_date is sorted in ascending order.
```

The output holds exactly one row per distinct `order_date`, and the ascending
order over those dates is total, so the row sequence is fully determined.
Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning two columns —
`order_date` and `immediate_percentage`, in that order — with the rows ordered
by `order_date` ascending.
