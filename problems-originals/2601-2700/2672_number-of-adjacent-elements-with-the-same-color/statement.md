# Number of Adjacent Elements With the Same Color

## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing an array `colors` of length `n`
where all elements are set to 0's meaning uncolored. You are also given a
2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [indexi, colori]`.

For the ith query:

- Set `colors[indexi]` to `colori`.
- Count the number of adjacent pairs in `colors` which have the same color
  (regardless of `colori`).

Return an array `answer` of the same length as `queries` where `answer[i]`
is the answer to the ith query.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 4, queries = [[0,2],[1,2],[3,1],[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [0,1,1,0,2]
Explanation:
Initially array colors = [0,0,0,0], where 0 denotes uncolored elements of
the array.
After the 1st query colors = [2,0,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with
the same color is 0.
After the 2nd query colors = [2,2,0,0]. The count of adjacent pairs with
the same color is 1.
After the 3rd query colors = [2,2,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with
the same color is 1.
After the 4th query colors = [2,1,0,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with
the same color is 0.
After the 5th query colors = [2,1,1,1]. The count of adjacent pairs with
the same color is 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 1, queries = [[0,100000]]
Output: [0]
Explanation:
After the 1st query colors = [100000]. The count of adjacent pairs with
the same color is 0.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10⁵`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= indexi <= n - 1`
- `1 <= colori <= 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Since at each query, only one element is being recolored, we just need to focus on its neighbors.

### Hint 2

If an element that is changed on the i-th query had the same color as its right element answer decreases by 1. Similarly contributes its left element too.

### Hint 3

After changing the color, if the element has the same color as its right element answer increases by 1. Similarly contributes its left element too.
