# Differences Between Two Objects

## Description

Write a function that accepts two deeply nested objects or arrays obj1 and
obj2 and returns a new object representing their differences.

The function should compare the properties of the two objects and identify
any changes. The returned object should only contains keys where the value
is different from obj1 to obj2.

For each changed key, the value should be represented as an array
[obj1 value, obj2 value]. Keys that exist in one object but not in the
other should not be included in the returned object. The end result should
be a deeply nested object where each leaf value is a difference array.

When comparing two arrays, the indices of the arrays are considered to be
their keys.

You may assume that both objects are the output of JSON.parse.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only — LeetCode offers no other languages for it. Your submission declares
`class Solution` with the method `solve(diffCase)`, where `diffCase` is a
bundle-provided `DiffCase` carrying `.obj1` and `.obj2`, the two deeply
nested structures under comparison. Implement `objDiff(obj1, obj2)` per
the rules above, then invoke `diffCase.drive(objDiff)` once — `drive`
calls your function with the case's pair and records whatever it returns;
that recorded object is the judged answer.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
obj1 = {}
obj2 = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2
}
Output: {}
Explanation: There were no modifications made to obj1. New keys "a" and "b" appear in obj2, but keys that are added or removed should be ignored.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
obj1 = {
  "a": 1,
  "v": 3,
  "x": [],
  "z": {
    "a": null
  }
}
obj2 = {
  "a": 2,
  "v": 4,
  "x": [],
  "z": {
    "a": 2
  }
}
Output:
{
  "a": [1, 2],
  "v": [3, 4],
  "z": {
    "a": [null, 2]
  }
}
Explanation: The keys "a", "v", and "z" all had changes applied. "a" was changed from 1 to 2. "v" was changed from 3 to 4. "z" had a change applied to a child object. "z.a" was changed from null to 2.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
obj1 = {
  "a": 5,
  "v": 6,
  "z": [1, 2, 4, [2, 5, 7]]
}
obj2 = {
  "a": 5,
  "v": 7,
  "z": [1, 2, 3, [1]]
}
Output:
{
  "v": [6, 7],
  "z": {
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": {
      "0": [2, 1]
    }
  }
}
Explanation: In obj1 and obj2, the keys "v" and "z" have different assigned values. "a" is ignored because the value is unchanged. In the key "z", there is a nested array. Arrays are treated like objects where the indices are keys. There were two alterations to the the array: z[2] and z[3][0]. z[0] and z[1] were unchanged and thus not included. z[3][1] and z[3][2] were removed and thus not included.
```

### Example 4

```text
Input:
obj1 = {
  "a": {"b": 1},
}
obj2 = {
  "a": [5],
}
Output:
{
  "a": [{"b": 1}, [5]]
}
Explanation: The key "a" exists in both objects. Since the two associated values have different types, they are placed in the difference array.
```

### Example 5

```text
Input:
obj1 = {
  "a": [1, 2, {}],
  "b": false
}
obj2 = {
  "b": false,
  "a": [1, 2, {}]
}
Output:
{}
Explanation: Apart from a different ordering of keys, the two objects are identical so an empty object is returned.
```

### Constraints

- obj1 and obj2 are valid JSON objects or arrays
- 2 <= JSON.stringify(obj1).length <= 10⁴
- 2 <= JSON.stringify(obj2).length <= 10⁴

## Hints

### Hint 1

Find the intersection of the keys/indices on the two arrays/objects.

### Hint 2

Analyze the data structure recursively.

### Hint 3

For each key in the intersection, omit if there are no differences in the
leaves. Otherwise return the difference.
