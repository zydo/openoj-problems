# Promise Pool

## Description

Given an array of asynchronous functions functions and a pool limit n,
return an asynchronous function promisePool. It should return a promise
that resolves when all the input functions resolve.

Pool limit is defined as the maximum number promises that can be pending
at once. promisePool should begin execution of as many functions as
possible and continue executing new functions when old promises resolve.
promisePool should execute functions[i] then functions[i + 1] then
functions[i + 2], etc. When the last promise resolves, promisePool should
also resolve.

For example, if n = 1, promisePool will execute one function at a time in
series. However, if n = 2, it first executes two functions. When either of
the two functions resolve, a 3rd function should be executed (if
available), and so on until there are no functions left to execute.

You can assume all functions never reject. It is acceptable for
promisePool to return a promise that resolves any value.

**Note (OpenOJ):** this problem is offered in JavaScript and TypeScript
only, and its timing runs on a deterministic virtual clock instead of real
timers. Your submission defines `promisePool(functions, n)` and declares a
class `Solution` whose `run(driver)` hands that function over with
`return driver.drive(promisePool)`. On the virtual clock each case's
function i is an async job with one parameter, its delay d_i: calling it
starts the job immediately and its promise settles at start + d_i, and at
most n jobs may be pending at once — when slots free up, they are filled
greedily in index order across simultaneous settlements too, so every
start and end tick is fully determined. The driver records both ticks for
every function and compares them exactly: `[starts[], ends[]]`. Settling
promise values are ignored (`null` settles everywhere); only the schedule
is judged. In the examples below, the crawled Output column shows how
LeetCode's wall-clock harness displayed completion times; OpenOJ judges
the start/end schedule instead — same machines, same numbers on any run.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
functions = [
  () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 300)),
  () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 400)),
  () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200))
]
n = 2
Output: [[300,400,500],500]
Explanation:
Three functions are passed in. They sleep for 300ms, 400ms, and 200ms
respectively.
They resolve at 300ms, 400ms, and 500ms respectively. The returned promise resolves at 500ms.
At t=0, the first 2 functions are executed. The pool size limit of 2 is reached.
At t=300, the 1st function resolves, and the 3rd function is executed. Pool size is 2.
At t=400, the 2nd function resolves. There is nothing left to execute. Pool size is 1.
At t=500, the 3rd function resolves. Pool size is zero so the returned promise also resolves.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
functions = [
  () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 300)),
  () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 400)),
  () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200))
]
n = 5
Output: [[300,400,200],400]
Explanation:
The three input promises resolve at 300ms, 400ms, and 200ms respectively.
The returned promise resolves at 400ms.
At t=0, all 3 functions are executed. The pool limit of 5 is never met.
At t=200, the 3rd function resolves. Pool size is 2.
At t=300, the 1st function resolves. Pool size is 1.
At t=400, the 2nd function resolves. Pool size is 0, so the returned
promise also resolves.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input:
functions = [
  () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 300)),
  () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 400)),
  () => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 200))
]
n = 1
Output: [[300,700,900],900]
Explanation:
The three input promises resolve at 300ms, 700ms, and 900ms respectively.
The returned promise resolves at 900ms.
At t=0, the 1st function is executed. Pool size is 1.
At t=300, the 1st function resolves and the 2nd function is executed. Pool size is 1.
At t=700, the 2nd function resolves and the 3rd function is executed. Pool size is 1.
At t=900, the 3rd function resolves. Pool size is 0 so the returned promise resolves.
```

### Constraints

- 0 <= functions.length <= 10
- 1 <= n <= 10

## Hints

### Hint 1

Initially execute all the functions until the queue fills up.

### Hint 2

Every time a function resolves, add a new promise to the queue if possible.
