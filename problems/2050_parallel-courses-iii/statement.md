# Parallel Courses III

## Description

You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses
labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `relations`
where `relations[j] = [prevCourse_j, nextCourse_j]` denotes that course
`prevCourse_j` has to be completed before course `nextCourse_j`
(prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a 0-indexed integer
array `time` where `time[i]` denotes how many months it takes to complete the
`(i+1)`th course.

You must find the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses
following these rules:

- You may start taking a course at any time if the prerequisites are met.
- Any number of courses can be taken at the same time.

Return the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses.

The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every
course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]], time = [3,2,5]
Output: 8
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course.
We start course 1 and course 2 simultaneously at month 0.
Course 1 takes 3 months and course 2 takes 2 months to complete respectively.
Thus, the earliest time we can start course 3 is at month 3, and the total time required is 3 + 5 = 8 months.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 5, relations = [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5],[3,4],[4,5]], time = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 12
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course.
You can start courses 1, 2, and 3 at month 0.
You can complete them after 1, 2, and 3 months respectively.
Course 4 can be taken only after course 3 is completed, i.e., after 3 months. It is completed after 3 + 4 = 7 months.
Course 5 can be taken only after courses 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed, i.e., after max(1,2,3,7) = 7 months.
Thus, the minimum time needed to complete all the courses is 7 + 5 = 12 months.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `0 <= relations.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 5 * 10⁴)`
- `relations[j].length == 2`
- `1 <= prevCourse_j, nextCourse_j <= n`
- `prevCourse_j != nextCourse_j`
- All the pairs `[prevCourse_j, nextCourse_j]` are unique.
- `time.length == n`
- `1 <= time[i] <= 10⁴`
- The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.

## Hints

### Hint 1

The earliest month at which course `j` can finish is `time[j]` plus the
maximum finishing month over all of its prerequisites — compute that finish
time for every course.

### Hint 2

Because the graph is a DAG, the finish times can be computed in any
topological order: when a course is popped from a Kahn queue, all of its
prerequisites already have their final finish times.

### Hint 3

The answer is the maximum finish time over all courses, i.e., the longest
path in the DAG where each node contributes its own duration as a weight.
