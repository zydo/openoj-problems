# Course Schedule II

## Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0`
to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where
`prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you must take course `b_i`
first if you want to take course `a_i`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]` indicates that to take course `0` you have to
first take course `1`.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there
are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all
courses, return an empty array.

### Example 1

```text
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you
should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you
should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be
taken after you have finished course 0. So one correct course order is
[0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i < numCourses`
- `a_i != b_i`
- All the pairs `prerequisites[i]` are unique.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Model the courses as a directed graph: each pair `[a, b]` is an edge
`b -> a`, and a valid course order is a topological ordering of that graph.

### Hint 2

A topological ordering exists if and only if the graph has no cycle; a cycle
means a course indirectly requires itself, so the answer is an empty array.

### Hint 3

Use Kahn's algorithm: repeatedly take any course whose remaining prerequisites
have all been taken (indegree zero), append it to the order, and decrement the
indegrees of the courses that depend on it. If the order ends up shorter than
`numCourses`, a cycle blocked the rest.
