# Solutions — First Pattern Match in a Bit Stream

Both solutions honor the same contract: the channel is read once, in
arrival order, and the search stops the instant the first occurrence
completes. They differ in what they carry across arrivals. The rolling
window keeps the last `m` bits themselves and asks of every arrival,
"is this now the pattern?" — a simple question, but answered up to `m`
entries deep. The KMP automaton keeps only a count of the pattern bits
currently matched and lets the pattern's failure function settle, from
that count and the next bit alone, where the count now stands — the same
verdict reached without ever re-reading what the channel can no longer
give back.

## Rolling bit window

The channel hands over each bit exactly once, in order, so the only state
worth carrying is the last `m` bits — the sole candidates for a match ending
at the current position. Maintain them as a window: on every `next()`, slide
the new bit in and drop the oldest. After the `t`-th read the window holds
bits `[t − m, t − 1]` (0-indexed), so comparing it with the pattern after
every arrival tests each possible start exactly once, and the first hit is
by construction the first occurrence.

The Python port packs the window into a single integer — shift left, OR the
new bit in, mask down to `m` bits — so each step is O(1) arithmetic on a
number below 2¹⁰⁰ and the comparison is one `==`. The other ports cannot
hold 100 bits in a native integer, so they keep a circular buffer of the
last `m` bits and compare up to `m` entries per step, exiting on the first
mismatch; across a prefix of at most 10⁵ bits that is at most 10⁷ elementary
comparisons, comfortably inside the time budget.

Both variants call `next()` exactly `first_index + m` times and stop — the
match is guaranteed to begin inside the recorded prefix, so the channel
never runs dry under a correct solution.

**Complexity:** `O(n · m)` time in the worst case for the circular-buffer
ports (`O(n)` arithmetic steps for the Python integer window), `O(m)` space,
where `n` is the number of bits read before the first match.

## KMP Failure Automaton

The channel's no-rewind rule is exactly the regime the failure function
was built for: the method never asks to see a bit twice. Before touching
the stream it builds the KMP table over the pattern alone — `fail[k]` is
the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a
suffix of its first `k` bits. The bits then run through the automaton one
arrival at a time: the state is the number of pattern bits matched so
far, and each new bit either extends the state by one or, on a mismatch,
walks it back through `fail` until the bit fits again.

The state after reading bit `t` is by construction the length of the
longest pattern prefix ending at `t`, so the first time the state reaches
`m` the match ends at `t` and begins at `t − m` — the returned index.
Every fallback shortens the state, and every unit of height it climbs was
raised by one distinct arrival, so the total fallback work is bounded by
the number of bits read and the scan is linear. All seven ports run the
identical array algorithm — one integer state and one table of `m + 1`
entries — with no bigint window and no per-language adaptation.

Like the rolling window, this variant calls `next()` exactly
`first_index + m` times and stops, far inside the 1 000 000-call budget;
the linear scan pays off in time, not in query count.

**Complexity:** `O(n + m)` time, `O(m)` space, where `n` is the number of
bits read before the first match.
