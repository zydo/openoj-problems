# Solutions — Least-Weight Subtree Joining Three Nodes

Both methods rest on the same pin: the cheapest edge set joining `a`, `b` and
`c` is the union of the three pairwise paths, each edge of that union lying on
exactly two of them, so the answer is `(d(a, b) + d(b, c) + d(c, a)) / 2` and
the entire task is the fast evaluation of tree distances. One rooted traversal
hands every distance over: root at node `0`, record each node's depth and
weighted root distance `f(x)`, and `d(x, y) = f(x) + f(y) - 2 * f(w)` with `w`
the lowest common ancestor — so the methods part ways only on how `w` is
found. Binary lifting stores ancestor jumps: a lookup raises the deeper node
by binary steps and hops both nodes upward in lockstep, `O(log n)` per query.
The Euler tour instead flattens the tree into a depth sequence where the
ancestor becomes a range minimum: between the first tour visits of two nodes
the shallowest entry is exactly their LCA, and a sparse table over that
sequence answers the range argmin in constant time.

## Binary Lifting LCA with Weighted Distances

Take three nodes `a`, `b`, `c`. The cheapest connected edge set that puts all
three in touch is the union of the three paths joining each pair, and that
union obeys a neat counting rule: each of its edges lies on exactly two of the
three paths (an edge in the shared middle core sits on all pairwise routes,
and the symmetry of the sum counts it twice). So the union's weight is exactly
`(d(a, b) + d(b, c) + d(c, a)) / 2`, and the entire task collapses to
evaluating pairwise tree distances fast.

Those distances come from one rooted traversal: root at node `0` and record
each node's depth and weighted root distance `f(x)`; then
`d(x, y) = f(x) + f(y) - 2 * f(w)` with `w` the lowest common ancestor. To
make `w` cheap, the code builds a binary-lifting table `up[k][v]` — the
`2^k`-th ancestor of `v` — by repeated doubling of the parent array. A lookup
first raises the deeper node by the binary expansion of the depth difference,
then walks both nodes up in lockstep while their lifted ancestors disagree.

The traversal is iterative, so a `10⁵`-node bamboo cannot blow the call stack,
and the root's parent entry points at the root itself so no lift falls off the
table. The three distances always sum to an even number — integer halving is
exact — and with up to `10⁵` queries the one-off `O(n log n)` build is
amortized without strain. On Example 1's tree, query `[0, 1, 5]` reads
distances `10`, `5`, and `15` for a union of `(10 + 5 + 15) / 2 = 15`, the
chain `0 - 3 - 1 - 5` with weights `4 + 6 + 5`.

**Complexity:** `O((n + q) log n)` time, `O(n log n)` space.

## Euler Tour RMQ LCA with Weighted Distances

Here the ancestor hunt becomes a range query. The traversal writes an Euler
tour: a node is appended when first visited and again each time one of its
child subtrees closes, flattening the tree into a sequence of `2n - 1` entries
that dips down into every subtree and climbs back out. Two recorded facts turn
that sequence into an LCA oracle — the first-visit slot `first[v]` of every
node, and the structural truth that the tour segment between the first visits
of two nodes never rises above their lowest common ancestor yet always
includes it, because the segment can only wander inside the ancestor's
subtree. The shallowest entry between `first[x]` and `first[y]` therefore is
the LCA itself, found without a single upward step.

Answering "shallowest entry in a range" in constant time is the sparse
table's job. `table[k][i]` holds the shallowest node over the `2^k` tour
entries starting at `i`; each level is built from the one below by comparing
the winners of its two half-windows, one `O(n)` pass per level for `O(n log n)`
in all. A query on `[l, r]` takes `k = floor(log2(r - l + 1))` and reads two
windows of length `2^k`, one starting at `l` and one ending at `r`, which
jointly cover the range and may overlap; overlap costs nothing because a
minimum may be taken twice without harm. The shallower of the two stored nodes
is the answer — two array reads and one comparison, whatever the range's
length.

The walk itself is the sibling's: iterative, so a `10⁵`-node bamboo cannot
blow the call stack, rooted at `0` with the root's parent entry set to a
sentinel no node can match, and the explicit `dist` array carrying the
positive edge weights so each distance is
`f(x) + f(y) - 2 * f(w)` without recursion. On Example 1's tree, taking
children in input-edge order, the tour reads `0 3 1 5 1 3 2 3 4 3 0`; for
query `[0, 1, 5]` the ancestor of `0` and `5` is the shallowest entry of
`0 3 1 5`, namely node `0`, and the three distances `10`, `5` and `15` again
total `(10 + 5 + 15) / 2 = 15`. The three distances always sum to an even
number — integer halving is exact — and constant-time lookups leave the query
loop linear in the query count alone.

The price sits in the build. The table towers over a `2n - 1` entry sequence
rather than over the node array, so it holds roughly twice the entries per
level of the lifting table plus one level more — the same `O(n log n)` class,
about `2n log n` stored node indices, each one depth indirection away from
comparison. In exchange every one of the `3q` ancestor lookups drops from
`O(log n)` pointer-chasing steps to `O(1)`, the better trade exactly when
queries rival nodes in number, as the `10⁵`-query ceiling allows.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n + q)` time, `O(n log n)` space.
