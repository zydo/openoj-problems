# Solutions — Counting Deluxe Numbers Between Two Bounds

A number is deluxe when its own digits are strictly monotone, or when the
sum of its digits forms a strictly monotone number. Both "sleek" sets are
small: a strictly monotone integer has at most ten distinct digits, and a
digit sum of a number below 10¹⁵ is at most 144. Counting directly by a
single sweep is therefore replaced by counting three manageable sets and
combining them.

## Sleek sets and a digit-sum DP

First precompute the strictly monotone numbers (the sleek set): every
nonempty subset of the digits 1–9, arranged increasingly, gives one
strictly increasing number, and every nonempty subset of 0–9 with a
nonzero leading digit, arranged decreasingly, gives a strictly decreasing
number. The union has about 1500 elements, small enough to sort once and
binary-search per query. The sleek digit sums are exactly the sleek
numbers in [1, 144].

Three counts are then combined by inclusion–exclusion. `countSleekSum(x)`
is a digit DP over the decimal digits of x: a table `ways[k][t]` holds how
many k-digit tails (leading zeros allowed) sum to exactly t, so at each
position a digit below x's own fixes the prefix forever and the freed tail
can be counted in one step when the running sum plus that tail lands on a
sleek sum. `countSleek(x)` is a binary search over the precomputed sleek
numbers, and `countOverlap(x)` counts sleek numbers whose digit sum is
also sleek, so the double-counted numbers can be subtracted. The answer
for [l, r] is the three counts evaluated at r minus the same three
evaluated at l - 1.

The digit-sum table has only 145 columns and the sleek list only about
1500 entries, so both bounds are handled in about O(log n + 1) digit
steps. All intermediate counts stay below 10¹⁵, within the exact integer
range of a JS `Number`, and comfortably inside 64-bit integers in the
typed languages.

**Complexity:** `O(log n)` time, `O(1)` space.
