# Solutions — Largest Solid-Rim Square

## 2-D prefix sums make each border test O(1)

A square has a solid rim when each of its four edges is an unbroken run of
1s. An edge of length `side` is unbroken exactly when the sum of its cells
equals `side`, so a 2-D prefix-sum table over the grid answers "what does
the strip from `(r, c1)` to `(r, c2)` sum to" with four table lookups — no
scanning, whatever the side length.

Building the prefix table is one `O(R·C)` pass. The search then enumerates
every top-left corner and every side length that fits, which is
`O(N³)` candidates for an `N×N` grid, each tested in constant time by four
strip queries (top row, bottom row, left column, right column). The answer
is the largest `side²` that passes, `0` if none does.

Iterating the side length from large to small per corner (or simply tracking
the maximum) keeps the loop simple; with `N <= 100` the cubic enumeration is
at most a million tests.

**Complexity:** `O(N³)` time for an `N×N` grid (`N <= 100`), after an
`O(N²)` prefix build — `O(N²)` space for the prefix table.
