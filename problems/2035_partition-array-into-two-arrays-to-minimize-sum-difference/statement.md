# Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of `2 * n` integers. You need to
partition `nums` into two arrays of length `n` to minimize the absolute
difference of the sums of the arrays. To partition `nums`, put each element of
`nums` into one of the two arrays.

Return the **minimum** possible absolute difference.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [3,9,7,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: One optimal partition is: [3,9] and [7,3].
The absolute difference between the sums of the arrays is abs((3 + 9) - (7 + 3)) = 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [-36,36]
Output: 72
Explanation: One optimal partition is: [-36] and [36].
The absolute difference between the sums of the arrays is abs((-36) - (36)) = 72.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [2,-1,0,4,-2,-9]
Output: 0
Explanation: One optimal partition is: [2,4,-9] and [-1,0,-2].
The absolute difference between the sums of the arrays is abs((2 + 4 + -9) - (-1 + 0 + -2)) = 0.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 15`
- `nums.length == 2 * n`
- `-10⁷ <= nums[i] <= 10⁷`

## Hints

### Hint 1

The target sum for the two partitions is sum(nums) / 2.

### Hint 2

Could you reduce the time complexity if you arbitrarily divide nums into two halves (two arrays)? Meet-in-the-Middle?

### Hint 3

For both halves, pre-calculate a 2D array where the kth index will store all possible sum values if only k elements from this half are added.

### Hint 4

For each sum of k elements in the first half, find the best sum of n-k elements in the second half such that the two sums add up to a value closest to the target sum from hint 1. These two subsets will form one array of the partition.
