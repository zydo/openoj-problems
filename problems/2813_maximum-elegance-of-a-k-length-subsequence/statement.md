# Maximum Elegance of a K-Length Subsequence

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `items` of length `n` and an integer
`k`.

`items[i] = [profit_i, category_i]`, where `profit_i` and `category_i` denote
the profit and category of the `i`-th item respectively.

Let's define the **elegance** of a subsequence of `items` as
`total_profit + distinct_categories^2`, where `total_profit` is the sum of all
profits in the subsequence, and `distinct_categories` is the number of distinct
categories from all the categories in the selected subsequence.

Your task is to find the maximum elegance from all subsequences of size `k` in
`items`.

Return an integer denoting the maximum elegance of a subsequence of `items`
with size exactly `k`.

Note: A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original
array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining
elements' relative order.

### Example 1

```text
Input: items = [[3,2],[5,1],[10,1]], k = 2
Output: 17
Explanation: In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 2.
We can select items[0] = [3,2] and items[2] = [10,1].
The total profit in this subsequence is 3 + 10 = 13, and the subsequence contains 2 distinct categories [2,1].
Hence, the elegance is 13 + 2^2 = 17, and we can show that it is the maximum achievable elegance.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: items = [[3,1],[3,1],[2,2],[5,3]], k = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 3.
We can select items[0] = [3,1], items[2] = [2,2], and items[3] = [5,3].
The total profit in this subsequence is 3 + 2 + 5 = 10, and the subsequence contains 3 distinct categories [1,2,3].
Hence, the elegance is 10 + 3^2 = 19, and we can show that it is the maximum achievable elegance.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: items = [[1,1],[2,1],[3,1]], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: In this example, we have to select a subsequence of size 3.
We should select all the items.
The total profit will be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the subsequence contains 1 distinct category [1].
Hence, the maximum elegance is 6 + 1^2 = 7.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= items.length == n <= 10^5`
- `items[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= profit_i <= 10^9`
- `1 <= category_i <= n`
- `1 <= k <= n`

## Hints

### Hint 1

A greedy algorithm can be applied.

### Hint 2

Sort the items in non-increasing order of profits.

### Hint 3

Select the first k items (the top k most profitable items) as the candidate set.

### Hint 4

For each remaining item sorted in non-increasing order of profits, try replacing a candidate: the replacing item should add a new category and remove the item with the minimum profit among categories that occur more than once.
