        # not match x shrinks off: dp[x][i+1][j] when s[i] != x, else
        # dp[x][i][j-1]. When both ends are x, gluing x onto both sides
        # of every palindromic interior gives 2 + sum_y dp[y][i+1][j-1]
        # — the +2 is "x" and "xx" — while adjacent ends carry only
        # those two. Every read stays in rows i and i+1, so two rolling
        # rows carry the table; the answer is sum_x dp[x][0][n-1].
