# Distance to a Cycle in Undirected Graph

## Description

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a
connected undirected graph containing exactly one cycle. The nodes are
numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (inclusive).

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where
`edges[i] = [node1i, node2i]` denotes that there is a bidirectional edge
connecting `node1i` and `node2i` in the graph.

The distance between two nodes `a` and `b` is defined to be the minimum
number of edges that are needed to go from `a` to `b`.

Return an integer array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the
minimum distance between the `ith` node and any node in the cycle.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[2,4],[4,3],[3,1],[0,1],[5,2],[6,5]]
Output: [1,0,0,0,0,1,2]
Explanation:
The nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 form the cycle.
The distance from 0 to 1 is 1.
The distance from 1 to 1 is 0.
The distance from 2 to 2 is 0.
The distance from 3 to 3 is 0.
The distance from 4 to 4 is 0.
The distance from 5 to 2 is 1.
The distance from 6 to 2 is 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 9, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2],[2,6],[6,7],[6,8],[0,3],[3,4],[3,5]]
Output: [0,0,0,1,2,2,1,2,2]
Explanation:
The nodes 0, 1, and 2 form the cycle.
The distance from 0 to 0 is 0.
The distance from 1 to 1 is 0.
The distance from 2 to 2 is 0.
The distance from 3 to 1 is 1.
The distance from 4 to 1 is 2.
The distance from 5 to 1 is 2.
The distance from 6 to 2 is 1.
The distance from 7 to 2 is 2.
The distance from 8 to 2 is 2.
```

### Constraints

- `3 <= n <= 10^5`
- `edges.length == n`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= node1i, node2i <= n - 1`
- `node1i != node2i`
- The graph is connected.
- The graph has exactly one cycle.
- There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

## Hints

### Hint 1

This problem can be broken down into two parts: finding the cycle, and finding the distance between each node and the cycle.

### Hint 2

To find the cycle, repeatedly remove nodes of degree 1 (tree leaves); whatever remains after this peeling process is exactly the cycle.

### Hint 3

Now that we know which nodes are part of the cycle, run a multi-source BFS starting from the nodes in the cycle and expanding outward.
