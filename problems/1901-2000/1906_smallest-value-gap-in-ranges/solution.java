        // gap between consecutive ones — present values arrive in
        // increasing order, and the minimum |a[i] - a[j]| over a set
        // always sits between value-adjacent elements. Fewer than two
        // rising rows means every element in the range matches, so the
        // answer is -1; with two or more the gap is at most 99, which
        // is what makes the untouched sentinel honest. The
        // 100 x (n+1) int table is ~40 MB — inside the memory budget —
        // and every count fits 32-bit by construction.
