# Minimum Time to Repair Cars

## Description

You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the ranks of some
mechanics. `ranks[i]` is the rank of the `ith` mechanic. A mechanic with a rank
`r` can repair `n` cars in `r * n^2` minutes.

You are also given an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars
waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return the minimum time taken to repair all the cars.

Note: All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

### Example 1

```text
Input: ranks = [4,2,3,1], cars = 10
Output: 16
Explanation:
- The first mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 4 * 2 * 2 = 16 minutes.
- The second mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 minutes.
- The third mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 minutes.
- The fourth mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: ranks = [5,1,8], cars = 6
Output: 16
Explanation:
- The first mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 minutes.
- The second mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
- The third mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 8 * 1 * 1 = 8 minutes.
It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= ranks.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= ranks[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= cars <= 10^6`

## Hints

### Hint 1

For a predefined fixed time, check whether all the cars can be repaired: a mechanic with rank r finishes floor(sqrt(t / r)) cars within time t.

### Hint 2

Binary search on the answer over the range from 1 up to min(ranks) * cars^2.

### Hint 3

The check is monotone: if all cars can be repaired in time t, they can also be repaired in any larger time.

### Hint 4

Sum the per-mechanic capacities during the check and compare against cars.
