# Solutions — Frog Jump

## DP over stones and last-jump sizes

Position alone is not enough state: whether the frog can progress from a stone depends on how long the jump that landed there was, since only jumps of `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1` may follow. So the DP tracks, for each stone `i`, the set `jumps[i]` of last-jump sizes that can land on it. Starting from `jumps[0] = {0}` (the pre-jump state whose only legal successor is a first jump of 1), the algorithm sweeps stones in order: every `(stone, last jump)` state fans out to the three candidate steps, and a step lands only if `position + step` is an actual stone, found through a hash map from position to index.

Because stones are strictly increasing and every step is at least 1, each landing target is strictly ahead of the current stone, so the forward sweep over `i` visits states in a valid order and each state is finalized before it is used. The frog can cross exactly when the last stone's set is non-empty. The state space stays small for a structural reason: a jump size can only grow by 1 per landing, so after `i` landings no jump exceeds `i` — each set holds at most `n` sizes and there are `n` stones, with each `(stone, size)` pair inserted once, matching the constraint of 2000 stones.

Edge cases: if the second stone is not at position 1, no legal first jump of size 1 reaches it, every set stays empty, and the answer is correctly false. Steps of `last - 1` that would be zero or negative are skipped, stones within a reachable distance but landing in water are silently ignored, and duplicate insertions into a set are free.

**Complexity:** `O(n²)` time, `O(n²)` space (worst case, for the jump-size sets).
