# Last Day Where You Can Still Cross

## Description

There is a 1-based binary matrix where `0` represents land and `1`
represents water. You are given integers `row` and `col` representing the
number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.

Initially on day `0`, the entire matrix is land. However, each day a new
cell becomes flooded with water. You are given a 1-based 2D array `cells`,
where `cells[i] = [r_i, c_i]` represents that on the `i^th` day (1-indexed),
the cell on the `r_i^th` row and `c_i^th` column (1-based coordinates) will
be covered with water (i.e. changed to `1`).

You want to find the last day that it is possible to walk from the top to
the bottom by only walking on land cells. You can start from any cell in
the top row and end at any cell in the bottom row. You can only travel in
the four cardinal directions (left, right, up, and down).

Return the last day where it is possible to walk from the top to the bottom.

### Example 1

```text
Input: row = 2, col = 2, cells = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The image above depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.
The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: row = 2, col = 2, cells = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The image above depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.
The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 1.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: row = 3, col = 3, cells = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,3],[2,2],[1,1],[1,3],[2,3],[3,2],[3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The image above depicts how the matrix changes each day starting from day 0.
The last day where it is possible to cross from top to bottom is on day 3.
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= row, col <= 2 * 10^4`
- `4 <= row * col <= 2 * 10^4`
- `cells.length == row * col`
- `1 <= r_i <= row`
- `1 <= c_i <= col`
- All the values of `cells` are unique.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Reachability between the top and bottom rows can be checked with BFS or DFS over the land cells.

### Hint 2

Once crossing becomes impossible it stays impossible, so binary search on the last day.

### Hint 3

Equivalently, process the days in reverse and union land cells back as they reappear.
