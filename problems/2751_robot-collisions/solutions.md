# Solutions — Robot Collisions

## Sorted Stack Simulation

Sort the robots by position and sweep left to right. Every collision involves a right-mover and a left-mover meeting face to face, so the only state needed is a stack of robots that have survived the sweep so far: right-movers are pushed as they come, and any left-moving robot must resolve duels against right-movers sitting on top of the stack before it can rest.

Each duel follows the rules directly: a strictly weaker stack top is popped and the incoming robot loses one health and keeps fighting the next top; a strictly stronger top survives with one less health and the incoming robot dies; equal health removes both. A left-mover that exhausts the right-movers on the stack is itself pushed — same-direction robots ahead of it can never collide with it. All health changes are written into the `healths` array so survivors carry their decremented values.

The survivors are exactly the stack contents, but the answer must be reported in the original input order, so the code collects the stack indices into a set and filters `range(n)` by membership. After the sort, each robot is pushed and popped at most once, making the simulation linear in the sweep.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space.
