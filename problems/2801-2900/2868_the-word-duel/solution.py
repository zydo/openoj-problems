        # every earlier play is <= that word, so words are never replayed.
        # Handing the opponent a larger threshold never helps them (their
        # reply options only shrink), so within one letter a player always
        # answers with their largest remaining word there, and a jump into
        # the next letter is played at that letter's largest word. After a
        # player spends their largest word of a letter they can never play
        # in that letter again, so the fight in each letter above the first
        # is one reply long: enter with your max, opponent answers with
        # theirs or exits upward, entrant exits upward or loses.

        # or jump to the next letter at once.
