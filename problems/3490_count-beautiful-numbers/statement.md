# Count Beautiful Numbers

## Description

You are given two positive integers, `l` and `r`. A positive integer is called
beautiful if the product of its digits is divisible by the sum of its digits.

Return the count of beautiful numbers between `l` and `r`, inclusive.

### Example 1

```text
Input: l = 10, r = 20
Output: 2
Explanation: The beautiful numbers in the range are 10 and 20.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: l = 1, r = 15
Output: 10
Explanation: The beautiful numbers in the range are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= l <= r < 10^9`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use digit dynamic programming.

### Hint 2

Track the sum and product of the digits chosen so far while building the number.
