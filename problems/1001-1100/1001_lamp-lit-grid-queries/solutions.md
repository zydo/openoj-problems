# Solutions — Lamp-Lit Grid Queries

## Row, column, and diagonal counters

`n` can be as large as `10^9`, so the board can never be materialized; its
rows, columns, and diagonals are indexed indirectly through hash maps
keyed by the coordinate that identifies them. A lamp at `(x, y)`
illuminates row `x`, column `y`, the diagonal `x - y`, and the
anti-diagonal `x + y`, so four counters — one map each for rows, columns,
diagonals, and anti-diagonals — track how many lamps currently light each
line. A set of the actual `(x, y)` lamp positions is kept alongside so a
lamp can be located and removed in O(1); it also lets duplicate lamp
entries be ignored, since turning on the same lamp twice must not inflate
a counter.

Answering a query `(x, y)` is then a lookup: the cell is lit if any of the
four counters for its row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal is positive.
After recording the answer, the 3x3 block centered on `(x, y)` is scanned;
every one of those 9 cells that holds a lamp is removed from the position
set and its four counters are decremented. This means a lamp switched off
by one query can no longer contribute to the lighting of a later query, so
answers must be produced strictly in query order.

**Complexity:** `O(lamps.length + queries.length)` time and
`O(lamps.length)` space.
