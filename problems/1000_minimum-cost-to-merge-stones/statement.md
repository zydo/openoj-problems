# Minimum Cost to Merge Stones

## Description

There are `n` piles of stones arranged in a row. The `i`th pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A move consists of merging exactly `k` consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `k` piles.

Return the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], k = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore. So the task is impossible.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], k = 3
Output: 25
Explanation: We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.
```

### Constraints

- `n == stones.length`
- `1 <= n <= 30`
- `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`
- `2 <= k <= 30`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Each merge reduces the pile count by k - 1, so the task is possible only when (n - 1) is divisible by (k - 1).

### Hint 2

Use interval dynamic programming: dp[i][j][m] is the minimum cost to reduce stones[i..j] to m piles.

### Hint 3

Combine a left interval reduced to one pile with a right interval reduced to m - 1 piles; whenever m reaches k, a merge costs the total stones in the interval.
