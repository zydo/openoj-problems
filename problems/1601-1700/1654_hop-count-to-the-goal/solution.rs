// a second consecutive backward jump. Breadth-first search by jump count
// reaches home in the fewest jumps; the line only needs to be explored
// up to max(x, max(forbidden)) + a + b, because above that line there is
// nothing to land on that matters, and each backward jump must be paid
// for by a following forward jump, so a useful overshoot tops out one
// forward step plus one backward reach higher.
