# Solutions — Courier Co-op Queries I

## Recursive CTE for the month scaffold, correlated subqueries per month

The output needs exactly twelve rows, one per month of 2020, whether
or not any courier or request touches that month — so the query cannot
simply group existing rows by month; it must first manufacture the
scaffold. `WITH RECURSIVE months (month) AS (...)` builds that
scaffold directly: the anchor row starts at `1`, and the recursive
step adds one more row per iteration while the previous value stays
below `12`, producing the integers `1` through `12` regardless of what
the courier and request tables contain.

Each scaffold row then drives two correlated scalar subqueries.
`active_couriers` counts `Couriers` rows whose `join_date` is strictly
before the first day of the _next_ calendar month — `date('2020-' ||
printf('%02d', months.month) || '-01', '+1 month')` — which is exactly
"on or before this month's last day" without needing to know how many
days that month has, and naturally includes couriers who joined in an
earlier year. `accepted_requests` joins `AcceptedRequests` to
`Requests` on `request_id` and counts the rows whose `requested_at`
falls in that exact year-month, compared with `strftime('%Y-%m',
...)` so a request's month counts once, tied to when it was placed
rather than to any later acceptance bookkeeping. `ORDER BY
months.month` finishes the query with the required ascending sort.

**Complexity:** proportional to twelve times the size of `Couriers`
plus `AcceptedRequests` joined with `Requests`, since each of the
twelve month rows re-scans the courier and request tables through its
own correlated subquery.
