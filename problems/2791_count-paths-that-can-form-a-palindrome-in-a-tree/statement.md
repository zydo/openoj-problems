# Count Paths That Can Form a Palindrome in a Tree

## Description

You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to the edge between `i` and `parent[i]`. `s[0]` can be ignored.

Return the number of pairs of nodes `(u, v)` such that `u < v` and the characters assigned to edges on the path from `u` to `v` can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backwards as forwards.

### Example 1

```text
Input: parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = "acaabc"
Output: 8
Explanation: The valid pairs are:
- All the pairs (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4) and (2,5) result in one character which is always a palindrome.
- The pair (2,3) results in the string "aca" which is a palindrome.
- The pair (1,5) results in the string "cac" which is a palindrome.
- The pair (3,5) results in the string "acac" which can be rearranged into the palindrome "acca".
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: parent = [-1,0,0,0,0], s = "aaaaa"
Output: 10
Explanation: Any pair of nodes (u,v) where u < v is valid.
```

### Constraints

- `n == parent.length == s.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`
- `parent[0] == -1`
- `parent` represents a valid tree.
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Hints

### Hint 1

A string can be rearranged into a palindrome exactly when the number of characters with an odd frequency is either 0 or 1.

### Hint 2

Let mask[v] be a mask of 26 bits that represents the parity of each character in the alphabet on the path from node 0 to v.

### Hint 3

Two nodes u and v form a valid pair exactly when mask[u] XOR mask[v] has at most one bit set.
