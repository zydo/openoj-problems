        # exactly and doubling moves scale it by a factor of 2, so along

        # and it starts at 1. Hence a reachable point's gcd must be a
        # power of two. The converse is constructive in reverse (Euclid
        # with halvings), so the test is simply gcd == 2^k, checked with
        # the classic g & (g - 1) == 0 trick. Coordinates are <= 10^9,
        # so every intermediate fits comfortably in machine words.
