        # reachability bitset over achievable totals covers every play:
        # value v extends exactly from totals t < v. A wide integer makes
        # that filter one AND against the low-v-bit mask plus one shift;
        # fixed-width languages walk the same totals descending instead.
        # The final total is always below 2 * max(rewardValues) <= 4000,
        # so nothing here leaves 32-bit range.
