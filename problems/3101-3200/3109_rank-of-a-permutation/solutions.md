# Solutions — Rank of a Permutation

Both solutions read the rank as the sum of the permutation's Lehmer digits:
slot `i` adds `(smaller still-available values) * (n - 1 - i)!`, totaled
modulo `10^9 + 7` over factorials precomputed to `(n - 1)!`. They differ
only in how the digits are harvested. The Fenwick tree walks the slots in
order, asking at each one how many unused values remain below it and
retiring the placed value on the spot. The merge sort banks one observation
— the values still unused at a slot are exactly its later slots, so every
digit is a count of smaller values sitting to the right — and recovers the
whole digit vector from a single divide-and-conquer pass, never processing
the slots in order at all.

## Lehmer code with a Fenwick tree

A permutation's dictionary position is the sum of its Lehmer digits: at
each slot, every arrangement that plants a smaller still-available value
there comes earlier, so slot `i` adds
`(available values below perm[i]) * (n - 1 - i)!` to the total. Adding
those contributions across all slots counts precisely the arrangements
listed before `perm`, which is its rank — reported modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Factorials through `(n - 1)!` come precomputed modulo `10^9 + 7`. The
per-slot count — available values below the one being placed — is a rank
query that must also support removals, which is a Fenwick tree's exact
job: seed it with a `1` at every value `1..n`; after slot `i` contributes
`query(perm[i] - 1) * fact[n - 1 - i]`, clear the value with a `-1`
update so later slots see only what is left. Because the input really is
a permutation, the tree drains to exactly zero by the final slot.

Walked on `[4,2,1,3]`: the opening `4` sees three smaller available
values, adding `3 * 3! = 18`; the `2` in slot one sees only `1`, adding
`1 * 2! = 2`; slot two's `1` adds nothing; total rank 20. The reversed
input `[4,3,2,1]` maximizes every digit at once, landing on `4! - 1 = 23`
— the last position, as expected — and the identity input collects zero
throughout and ranks 0.

Each slot pays two `O(log n)` tree operations, and the whole pipeline is
one pass over the array.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space.

## Lehmer code by merge-sort divide and conquer

The Fenwick sweep harvests the digits one slot at a time; this one drains
them all from a single pass. The values still unused when slot `i` is
filled are exactly the values sitting in later slots, so slot `i`'s Lehmer
digit — how many of them are smaller than `perm[i]` — is an inversion
count: smaller values to the right of position `i`. A merge sort that
tallies, for every element, how many later elements fall below it in value
therefore produces the entire digit vector in one divide-and-conquer, and
the same factorial table then assembles the rank modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The sort carries `(value, original index)` pairs in its workspace. Each
merge confronts two runs already ordered by value; when a left-run pair is
finally placed, every right-run pair already placed ahead of it is smaller
and — living in the right half of the array — later, so `j - mid`, the
right run's placed prefix, accrues to that pair's original index. Left
pairs move only on a strict `<`, which is exactly the strict-smaller
counting the rank asks for; a permutation offers no equal values for a tie
to matter, the same distinctness the Fenwick tree leans on when its counts
drain to zero. A closing sweep multiplies each digit by `(n - 1 - i)!` and
sums.

Walked on `[4,2,1,3]`: the `4` has three smaller values to its right, the
`2` one, the `1` and `3` none — `3 * 3! + 1 * 2! = 20`, the same digits the
Fenwick tree read off slot by slot. The reversed input `[4,3,2,1]`
maximizes every digit at once and lands on `4! - 1 = 23`; the identity
collects zeros throughout and ranks 0.

Each recursion level merges linear work across the whole array, and there
are `log n` levels; the closing factorial-weighted sum is one more pass.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space.
