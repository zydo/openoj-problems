// Only the letter counts matter; a good string has every count at 0 or
// at some common target c, and c never needs to exceed the largest
// count. For a fixed c each letter either keeps c copies (cost |occ-c|)
// or is deleted out (cost occ). One refinement: a unit in the letter
// just left of a kept letter that still needs copies can change into it
// instead — the hop replaces the delete the unit would pay anyway and
// saves an insert, worth 1 per unit, up to how many spare units the
// left letter has and how many copies the right letter still needs.
// Those flows only run between adjacent letters, so one pass over the
// alphabet carrying the previous letter's choice (kept or emptied)
// prices each target; the answer is the cheapest target.
