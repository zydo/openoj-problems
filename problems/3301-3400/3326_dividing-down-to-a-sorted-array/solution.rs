// A division replaces a composite x by its smallest prime factor (x's
// greatest proper divisor), and primes are stuck: their greatest proper
// divisor is 1, so dividing leaves them unchanged. Every element therefore
// ends as itself, or — for one operation — as its smallest prime factor.
// Scan from the right keeping the value the previous (righter) slot
// settled on: keep x when it fits (no operation, and the loosest bound for
// the left neighbor), otherwise divide once when the smallest prime factor
// fits, else the array is impossible. Smallest prime factors up to
// max(nums) come from one sieve pass.
