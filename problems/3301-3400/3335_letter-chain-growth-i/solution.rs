// Only the per-letter counts matter. One transformation shifts the
// 26-vector one letter up (each of b..z receives its predecessor's count)
// and splits every z into an a and a b: after the shift the new
// counts[0] is the old z-count, and the old a-count gains the old z-count
// on top. Reducing counts[1] below MOD per sweep keeps every entry below
// MOD forever: a sweep's entries stay below 2 * MOD, but the 26-bucket
// total reaches ~2.7 * 10^10, so everything accumulates in i64.
