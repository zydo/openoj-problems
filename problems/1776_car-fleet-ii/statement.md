# Car Fleet II

## Description

There are `n` cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array `cars` of length `n`, where `cars[i] = [positioni, speedi]` represents:

- `positioni` is the distance between the `ith` car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.
- `speedi` is the initial speed of the `ith` car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the slowest car in the fleet.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `ith` car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within `10⁻⁵` of the actual answers are accepted.

### Example 1

```text
Input: cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]
Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth car, and form a car fleet with speed 2 m/s.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: cars = [[3,4],[5,4],[6,3],[9,1]]
Output: [2.00000,1.00000,1.50000,-1.00000]
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= cars.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= positioni, speedi <= 10⁶`
- `positioni < positioni+1`

## Hints

### Hint 1

We can ignore the merging of any car fleet and simply assume they cross each other. The aim is to find the first car to the right that intersects with the current car before any other.

### Hint 2

Ignore all cars with speeds higher than the current car, since the current car cannot intersect with those.

### Hint 3

If a car c1 intersects c2 before the current car intersects c2, then c1 can never be the first car of intersection for any car to the left, so it can be removed.

### Hint 4

Maintain candidate cars in a stack, removing cars with speed greater than or equal to the current car, and then removing cars which can never be the first point of intersection.
