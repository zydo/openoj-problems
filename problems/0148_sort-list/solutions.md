# Solutions — Sort List

## Top-Down Merge Sort

Merge sort fits linked lists because every stage is pure relinking — no random access is ever needed. The list is halved with slow/fast pointers, each half is sorted recursively, and the two sorted halves are merged through a dummy head: repeatedly append the smaller front node and advance that half, then splice the leftover tail on when one side runs out. Taking from the first half on ties (`<=`) keeps the sort stable.

The midpoint walk starts fast one node ahead (`fast = head.next`), so slow finishes on the last node of the left half rather than the first node of the right. That detail is what makes the recursion terminate: cutting after slow leaves both halves strictly shorter than the original — even for a two-node list, which splits into single nodes — so the base case (empty or single-node list returned unchanged) is always reached.

Halving at the midpoint keeps the recursion depth logarithmic, and because the nodes themselves are rewired in place, no auxiliary arrays are allocated at any level. This is the top-down formulation; the follow-up's strict O(1) memory would require the bottom-up variant, but the relinking merge already delivers the O(n log n) time with only the call stack as extra space.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(log n)` space.
