// Problem-provided driver for 2667 create-hello-world-function.
// Assembled into every submission by the judge ahead of the submitted
// code; never editable in the editor. This file is the hidden
// implementation — solvers see only the public API documented in the
// statement.
//
// The driver owns one case's calls script (the same shape as the
// statement's Input). drive() receives the submission's makeGreeter
// factory, builds the returned function once, then replays each row of
// arguments through it and records whatever value comes back — a correct
// function answers "Hello World" every time, no matter what the rows
// carry. The recorded list is the judged verdict.
