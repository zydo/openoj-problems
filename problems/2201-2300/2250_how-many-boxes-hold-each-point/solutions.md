# Solutions — How Many Boxes Hold Each Point

## Bucket by height, then binary search

A point `(x, y)` is held by exactly the boxes with `length >= x` and
`height >= y`, so the question reduces to counting boxes in that
two-dimensional dominance region. The height axis is tiny — boxes only
reach `100` — so every box can be dropped into a height bucket once, and
each point then inspects only the `100` height buckets from `y` upward.
Within one bucket, all boxes share a height, so the containment test
collapses to `length >= x`, and the count of qualifying boxes is found with
a binary search over a sorted list.

The code first walks `rectangles` once, appending every length into the
bucket of its height, and sorts each bucket's lengths. For every point it
then loops
`h` from `y` to `100`, looking up how many lengths in bucket `h` are at least
`x` and adding those counts. Because a bucket holds only boxes of that
exact height, this counts precisely the boxes whose height covers `y` and
whose length covers `x` — no box is double-counted, and edge-on-boundary
points (`x == l`, `y == h`) are included by the `>=` comparisons.

The workload is dominated by the `100` binary searches per point. With
`rectangles.length` and `points.length` both up to `5·10⁴`, that stays well
inside the limits; the per-height buckets never re-scan the full box
list for a point the way a brute-force `O(R·P)` scan would.

**Complexity:** `O(R log R + 100·P log R)` time, `O(R)` space.
