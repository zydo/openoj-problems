    // larger of the two letter counts, and one sweep gathers all three
    // numbers: each pattern[1] is charged with the pattern[0]'s before
    // it. When both pattern letters are equal the same sweep yields
    // k*(k-1)/2 pairs plus a gain of k, which is exactly what one extra
    // copy of that letter adds.
