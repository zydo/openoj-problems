# Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths

## Description

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes of a weighted
directed graph. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where
`edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` denotes that there exists a directed edge
from `fromi` to `toi` with weight `weighti`.

Lastly, you are given three distinct integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest`
denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.

Return the minimum weight of a subgraph of the graph such that it is possible
to reach `dest` from both `src1` and `src2` via a set of edges of this
subgraph. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return `-1`.

A subgraph is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original
graph. The weight of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent
edges.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5
Output: 9
Explanation:
The blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.
Note that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer.
It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[2,1,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 2
Output: -1
Explanation:
It can be seen that there does not exist any path from node 1 to node 2,
hence there are no subgraphs satisfying all the constraints.
```

### Constraints

- `3 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= fromi, toi, src1, src2, dest <= n - 1`
- `fromi != toi`
- `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` are pairwise distinct.
- `1 <= weight[i] <= 10^5`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Consider what the paths from src1 to dest and src2 to dest would look like in the optimal solution.

### Hint 2

It can be shown that in an optimal solution, the two paths from src1 and src2 coincide at one node, and the remaining part to dest is the same for both paths. Now consider how to find the node where the paths coincide.

### Hint 3

How can algorithms for finding the shortest path between two nodes help us?
