# Median of a Row Wise Sorted Matrix

## Description

Given an `m x n` matrix `grid` containing an odd number of integers where
each row is sorted in non-decreasing order, return the median of the matrix.

You must solve the problem in less than `O(m * n)` time complexity.

### Example 1

```text
Input: grid = [[1,1,2],[2,3,3],[1,3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The elements of the matrix in sorted order are 1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4. The median is 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: grid = [[1,1,3,3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The elements of the matrix in sorted order are 1,1,3,3,4. The median is 3.
```

### Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `m` and `n` are both odd.
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^6`
- `grid[i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Hints

### Hint 1

How can you use the fact that the rows are sorted in non-decreasing order to solve the problem efficiently?

### Hint 2

Try to binary search the answer.
