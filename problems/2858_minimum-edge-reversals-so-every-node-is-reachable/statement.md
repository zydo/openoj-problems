# Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable

## Description

There is a simple directed graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.
The graph would form a tree if its edges were bi-directional.

You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges`, where
`edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a directed edge going from node `ui` to
node `vi`.

An edge reversal changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going
from node `ui` to node `vi` becomes a directed edge going from node `vi` to
node `ui`.

For every node `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, your task is to independently
calculate the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to
reach any other node starting from node `i` through a sequence of directed
edges.

Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the minimum number of
edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from
node `i` through a sequence of directed edges.

### Example 1

```text
Input: n = 4, edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[1,3]]
Output: [1,1,0,2]
Explanation:
For node 0: after reversing the edge [2,0], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0. So answer[0] = 1.
For node 1: after reversing the edge [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 1. So answer[1] = 1.
For node 2: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 2. So answer[2] = 0.
For node 3: after reversing the edges [1,3] and [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 3. So answer[3] = 2.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,0]]
Output: [2,0,1]
Explanation:
For node 0: after reversing the edges [2,0] and [1,2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0. So answer[0] = 2.
For node 1: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 1. So answer[1] = 0.
For node 2: after reversing the edge [1,2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 2. So answer[2] = 1.
```

### Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ui, vi < n`
- `ui != vi`
- The input is generated such that if the edges were bi-directional, the graph would be a tree.

## Hints

### Hint 1

The problem can be solved using tree DP.

### Hint 2

Root the tree at node 0 and let dp[x] be the minimum number of edge reversals so node x can reach every node in its subtree.

### Hint 3

Using a DFS traversing the edges bidirectionally, compute dp[x] = dp[y] + (1 if the edge between x and y is going from y to x; 0 otherwise), where x is the parent of y.

### Hint 4

Using a second DFS from node 0, compute answer[y] = answer[x] + (1 if the edge between x and y is going from x to y; -1 otherwise), where x is the parent of y.
