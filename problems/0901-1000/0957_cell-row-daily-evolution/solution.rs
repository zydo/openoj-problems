// Eight two-state cells admit at most 256 rows, and day one vacates both
// end cells, leaving 64 — the deterministic daily map must loop. Hash each
// row (as its 8-bit mask) to its first day; when the row reappears on day
// `day` after first being seen on day `first`, the future repeats that
// day - first cycle, so only (n - day) % cycle further transitions remain.
