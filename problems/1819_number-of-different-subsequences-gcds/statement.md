# Number of Different Subsequences GCDs

## Description

You are given an array `nums` that consists of positive integers.

The `GCD` of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence evenly.

- For example, the `GCD` of the sequence `[4,6,16]` is `2`.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

- For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10]`.

Return the number of different `GCD`s among all non-empty subsequences of `nums`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [6,10,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: The figure shows all the non-empty subsequences and their GCDs.
The different GCDs are 6, 10, 3, 2, and 1.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [5,15,40,5,6]
Output: 7
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10⁵`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Think of how to check if a number x is a gcd of a subsequence.

### Hint 2

If there is such a subsequence, then all of its elements will be divisible by x. Moreover, if you divide each number in the subsequence by x, then the gcd of the resulting numbers will be 1.

### Hint 3

Adding a number to a subsequence cannot increase its gcd. So, if there is a valid subsequence for x, then the subsequence that contains all multiples of x is a valid one too.

### Hint 4

Iterate on all possible x from 1 to 10⁵, and check if there is a valid subsequence for x.
