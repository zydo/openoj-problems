# Remove Stones to Minimize the Total

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `piles`, where `piles[i]` represents
the number of stones in the `i`th pile, and an integer `k`. You should apply
the following operation exactly `k` times:

- Choose any `piles[i]` and remove `floor(piles[i] / 2)` stones from it.

Notice that you can apply the operation on the same pile more than once.

Return the minimum possible total number of stones remaining after applying
the `k` operations.

`floor(x)` is the largest integer that is smaller than or equal to `x` (i.e.,
rounds `x` down).

### Example 1

```text
Input: piles = [5,4,9], k = 2
Output: 12
Explanation: Steps of a possible scenario are:
- Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [5,4,5].
- Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [3,4,5].
The total number of stones in [3,4,5] is 12.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: piles = [4,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: Steps of a possible scenario are:
- Apply the operation on pile 2. The resulting piles are [4,3,3,7].
- Apply the operation on pile 3. The resulting piles are [4,3,3,4].
- Apply the operation on pile 0. The resulting piles are [2,3,3,4].
The total number of stones in [2,3,3,4] is 12.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= piles.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Choose the pile with the maximum number of stones each time.

### Hint 2

Use a data structure that helps you find the mentioned pile each time efficiently.

### Hint 3

One such data structure is a Priority Queue (max-heap).
