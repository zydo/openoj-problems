// An operation retargets one character anywhere, so only letter counts
// matter. Condition 3 unifies both strings on one letter c: every
// character that is not already c pays once. Conditions 1 and 2 share a
// boundary after letter c — the lower string pays its letters above c,
// the higher one its letters at or below c — and one sweep with running
// below/above totals prices both orientations at once. The boundary
// stops after 'y': nothing can sit above 'z', so 'z' can never cap the
// lower string.
