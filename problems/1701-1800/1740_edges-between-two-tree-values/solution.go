// One iterative pass — an explicit stack, never recursion, since a
// skewed tree runs 10^4 nodes deep — records each value's depth and
// parent. Values are unique, so a value keys both maps. The distance
// then resolves through the lowest common ancestor: lift the deeper of
// p and q to the other's depth, walk both up in lockstep until they
// meet — that meeting point is the LCA — and return depth[p] +
// depth[q] - 2*depth[lca], each leg of the path counted once. p == q
// needs no special case: the lifts make no move, the walk finds the
// two already equal, and the formula cancels to 0. The root records
// itself as its own parent; no climb ever passes the LCA, which is at
// the latest the root, so the sentinel is never followed.
