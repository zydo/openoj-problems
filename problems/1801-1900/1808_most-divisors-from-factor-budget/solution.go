// A full divisor carries at least one copy of every prime of n, so for
// n = p^a * q^b * ... the full divisors number a * b * ...: the answer is
// the largest product of positive integers summing to at most primeFactors,
// and a part of size 1 never changes a product, so the budget is spent
// exactly. Break rule: a part x > 4 splits into floor(x/2) + ceil(x/2) with
// a larger product, and three 2s lose to two 3s, so only 3s and at most two
// 2s remain -- n <= 4 answers n itself; n%3 == 0 -> 3^(n/3); n%3 == 1 -> 4 *
// 3^((n-4)/3), where 2 + 2 beats 3 + 1; n%3 == 2 -> 2 * 3^(n/3). The
// exponent reaches 10^9 / 3, so the power runs as an iterative
// square-and-multiply over residues mod 10^9 + 7 (~30 rounds). Every
// operand stays below the modulus, so a product is at most (10^9 + 6)^2 <
// 2^63, safely inside the int64 used here.
