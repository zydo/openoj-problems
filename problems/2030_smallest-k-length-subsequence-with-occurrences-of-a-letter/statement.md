# Smallest K-Length Subsequence With Occurrences of a Letter

## Description

You are given a string `s`, an integer `k`, a `letter`, and an integer
`repetition`.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** subsequence of `s` of length `k` that
has the `letter` appear **at least** `repetition` times. The test cases are
generated so that the `letter` appears in `s` at least `repetition` times.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by
deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining
characters.

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` if in the first
position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears
earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "leet", k = 3, letter = "e", repetition = 1
Output: "eet"
Explanation: There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter 'e' appear at least 1 time:
- "lee" (from "leet")
- "let" (from "leet")
- "let" (from "leet")
- "eet" (from "leet")
The lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is "eet".
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 4, letter = "e", repetition = 2
Output: "ecde"
Explanation: "ecde" is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length 4 that has the letter "e" appear at least 2 times.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: s = "bb", k = 2, letter = "b", repetition = 2
Output: "bb"
Explanation: "bb" is the only subsequence of length 2 that has the letter "b" appear at least 2 times.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= repetition <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `letter` is a lowercase English letter, and appears in `s` at least
  `repetition` times.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Use a stack. For every character to be appended, decide how many characters from the stack need to get popped based on the stack length and the count of the required character.

### Hint 2

Pop the extra characters out from the stack and return the characters in the stack (reversed).
