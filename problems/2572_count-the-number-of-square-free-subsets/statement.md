# Count the Number of Square-Free Subsets

## Description

You are given a positive integer 0-indexed array `nums`.

A subset of the array `nums` is square-free if the product of its elements is a
square-free integer.

A square-free integer is an integer that is divisible by no square number other
than 1.

Return the number of square-free non-empty subsets of the array `nums`. Since
the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10⁹ + 7`.

A non-empty subset of `nums` is an array that can be obtained by deleting some
(possibly none but not all) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if
and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [3,4,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 square-free subsets in this example:
- The subset consisting of the 0th element [3]. The product of its elements is 3, which is a square-free integer.
- The subset consisting of the 3rd element [5]. The product of its elements is 5, which is a square-free integer.
- The subset consisting of 0th and 3rd elements [3,5]. The product of its elements is 15, which is a square-free integer.
It can be proven that there are no more than 3 square-free subsets in the given array.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 square-free subset in this example:
- The subset consisting of the 0th element [1]. The product of its elements is 1, which is a square-free integer.
It can be proven that there is no more than 1 square-free subset in the given array.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`

## Hints

### Hint 1

There are 10 primes before the number 30.

### Hint 2

Label the primes from {2, 3, ..., 29} with {0, 1, ..., 9} and let DP(i, mask) denote the number of subsets before index i whose product uses exactly the set of primes in mask.

### Hint 3

If the mask of prime factors of nums[i] shares a prime with the current mask, nums[i] cannot be added; otherwise it can.
