# Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

## Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of vowel
letters in any substring of `s` with length `k`.

Vowel letters in English are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

### Example 1

```text
Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: s = "aeiou", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= s.length`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Keep a window of size k and maintain the number of vowels in it.

### Hint 2

Keep moving the window and update the number of vowels while moving; the answer is the maximum vowel count of any window.
