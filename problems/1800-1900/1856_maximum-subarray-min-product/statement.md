# Maximum Subarray Min-Product

## Description

The **min-product** of an array is equal to the **minimum value** in the
array multiplied by the array's **sum**.

- For example, the array `[3,2,5]` (minimum value is `2`) has a min-product
  of `2 * (3+2+5) = 2 * 10 = 20`.

Given an array of integers `nums`, return _the maximum min-product of any
non-empty subarray of_ `nums`. Since the answer may be large, return it
**modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

Note that the min-product should be maximized before performing the modulo
operation. Testcases are generated such that the maximum min-product without
modulo will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of an array.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 14
Explanation: The maximum min-product is achieved with the subarray [2,3,2] (minimum value is 2).
2 * (2+3+2) = 2 * 7 = 14.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [2,3,3,1,2]
Output: 18
Explanation: The maximum min-product is achieved with the subarray [3,3] (minimum value is 3).
3 * (3+3) = 3 * 6 = 18.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [3,1,5,6,4,2]
Output: 60
Explanation: The maximum min-product is achieved with the subarray [5,6,4] (minimum value is 4).
4 * (5+6+4) = 4 * 15 = 60.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`

## Hints

### Hint 1

For each element, find the subarray in which it is the minimum: use a monotonic stack to determine the nearest smaller elements on both sides.

### Hint 2

With prefix sums, each element's best min-product is its value times the sum of that widest subarray; take the maximum before applying the modulo.
