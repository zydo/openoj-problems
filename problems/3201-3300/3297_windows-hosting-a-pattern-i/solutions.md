# Solutions — Windows That Can Host A Pattern I

A substring can host `word2` exactly when it contains at least as many
copies of every letter as `word2` does, and this covering property is
monotone: once a window covers `word2`, every extension of that window
still does. So for each left endpoint there is a single threshold right
end — the first index where the window starts to cover — and every choice
of right end from that threshold through the last index yields a hosting
substring.

## Minimal covering window per left endpoint with a two-pointer sweep

Slide a single right end across `word1` while maintaining the frequency
counts of the current window. After each extension, shrink from the left
for as long as the window still covers `word2`'s counts; when shrinking
stops, `left - 1` marks, for this right end, the latest start whose window
covers, so the suffix starting anywhere in `[left - 1..right]` is a host
ending at `right`, contributing `right - left + 2` substrings.
Each index enters and leaves the window once, giving linear time overall.

The count accumulates in a 64-bit integer: with `n = 10⁵` identical
letters and a one-letter `word2`, the answer is the triangular number
`n * (n + 1) / 2 = 5000050000`, which overflows a signed 32-bit integer.
In JavaScript the same bound stays far inside the exact-integer range of
IEEE doubles (below 2⁵³), so ordinary numbers are exact there.

**Complexity:** `O(n)` time (26 letters constant factor; each pointer
moves monotonically), `O(1)` space (fixed 26-entry count arrays).
