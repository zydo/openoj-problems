# Count Non-Decreasing Subarrays After K Operations

## Description

You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `k`.

For each subarray of `nums`, you can apply up to `k` operations on it. In each operation, you increment any element of the subarray by `1`.

Note that each subarray is considered independently, meaning changes made to one subarray do not persist to another.

Return the number of subarrays that you can make non-decreasing after performing at most `k` operations.

An array is said to be non-decreasing if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element, if it exists.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [6,3,1,2,4,4], k = 7
Output: 17
Explanation: Out of all 21 possible subarrays of nums, only the subarrays [6, 3, 1], [6, 3, 1, 2], [6, 3, 1, 2, 4] and [6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4] cannot be made non-decreasing after applying up to k = 7 operations. Thus, the number of non-decreasing subarrays is 21 - 4 = 17.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [6,3,1,3,6], k = 4
Output: 12
Explanation: The subarray [3, 1, 3, 6] along with all subarrays of nums with three or fewer elements, except [6, 3, 1], can be made non-decreasing after k operations. There are 5 subarrays of a single element, 4 subarrays of two elements, and 2 subarrays of three elements except [6, 3, 1], so there are 1 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 12 subarrays that can be made non-decreasing.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`
- `1 <= k <= 10⁹`

## Hints

### Hint 1

For a subarray, the minimum number of operations is the sum over its elements of (the running maximum so far minus the element).

### Hint 2

Use a sliding window with a monotonic stack to maintain the running maximums and the operation cost as the window changes.
