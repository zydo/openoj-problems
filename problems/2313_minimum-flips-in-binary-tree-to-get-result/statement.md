# Minimum Flips in Binary Tree to Get Result

## Description

You are given the root of a binary tree with the following properties:

- Leaf nodes have either the value `0` or `1`, representing `false` and `true`
  respectively.
- Non-leaf nodes have either the value `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`, representing the
  boolean operations `OR`, `AND`, `XOR`, and `NOT`, respectively.

You are also given a boolean `result`, which is the desired result of the
evaluation of the root of the tree.

The evaluation of a node is as follows:

- If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e.
  `true` or `false`.
- Otherwise, evaluate the node's children and apply the boolean operation of
  its value with the children's evaluations.

In one operation, you can flip a leaf node, which causes a `false` node to
become `true`, and a `true` node to become `false`.

Return the minimum number of operations that need to be performed such that the
evaluation of the root of the tree yields `result`. It can be shown that there
is always a way to achieve `result`.

A leaf node is a node that has zero children.

Note: `NOT` nodes have either a left child or a right child, but other non-leaf
nodes have both a left child and a right child.

### Example 1

```text
Input: root = [3,5,4,2,null,1,1,1,0], result = true
Output: 2
Explanation: It can be shown that a minimum of 2 nodes have to be flipped to
make the root of the tree evaluate to true.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: root = [0], result = false
Output: 0
Explanation: The root of the tree already evaluates to false, so 0 nodes have
to be flipped.
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5`
- `OR`, `AND`, and `XOR` nodes have 2 children.
- `NOT` nodes have 1 child.
- Leaf nodes have a value of `0` or `1`.
- Non-leaf nodes have a value of `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`.

## Hints

### Hint 1

Try using tree DP to solve this problem.

### Hint 2

Find the minimum operations to change each subtree to true and to false separately.

### Hint 3

For nodes representing boolean operations, find the minimum operations by trying all combinations of values to which the child nodes can evaluate.
