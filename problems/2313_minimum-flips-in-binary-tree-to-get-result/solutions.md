# Solutions — Minimum Flips in Binary Tree to Get Result

## Bottom-Up Tree DP on (min-true, min-false)

For every node define two values: `t(node)`, the minimum leaf flips needed to make the subtree rooted at `node` evaluate to true, and `f(node)`, the minimum to make it evaluate to false. Since flips happen only at leaves and the operations at internal nodes are fixed, these two numbers fully summarize a subtree for every parent — the parent does not care how a child's value is achieved, only what it costs to get either value. That makes the pair a composable DP state.

The recurrences mirror each operator. A leaf valued `1` costs `(0, 1)` and a leaf valued `0` costs `(1, 0)`. An OR node is true if either child is true — pay `min(lt, rt)` — and false only if both are false — pay `lf + rf`. An AND node is the mirror image: `lt + rt` to be true, `min(lf, rf)` to be false. A XOR node is true when the children differ, so `t = min(lt + rf, lf + rt)`, and false when they match, `f = min(lt + rt, lf + rf)`. A NOT node simply swaps its single child's two costs (the child is the left one if present, otherwise the right).

The canonical solution evaluates the DP iteratively to avoid recursion-depth issues on trees of up to `10^5` nodes: a BFS from the root records the nodes in level order, then the arrays `t` and `f` are filled by scanning that order in reverse, so children are always finalized before their parents. A dictionary maps each node to its index for `O(1)` child lookups. The answer is `t[root]` when `result` is true and `f[root]` otherwise; a single-leaf tree and a `None` root are handled by the leaf base case and an upfront guard. Both values are always finite because any leaf can be flipped.

**Complexity:** `O(N)` time, `O(N)` space, for a tree with `N` nodes.
