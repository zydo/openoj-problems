# Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps

## Description

Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are
given a 2D integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i] = [position_i, amount_i]`
depicts `amount_i` fruits at the position `position_i`. `fruits` is already
sorted by `position_i` in ascending order, and each `position_i` is unique.

You are also given an integer `startPos` and an integer `k`. Initially, you
are at the position `startPos`. From any position, you can either walk to the
left or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can
walk at most `k` steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest
all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that
position.

Return the maximum total number of fruits you can harvest.

### Example 1

```text
Input: fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 9
Explanation:
The optimal way is to:
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits
- Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits
You moved 3 steps and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 14
Explanation:
You can move at most k = 4 steps, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10.
The optimal way is to:
- Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5
- Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits
- Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits
You moved 1 + 3 = 4 steps and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total.
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: fruits = [[0,3],[6,4],[8,5]], startPos = 3, k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
You can move at most k = 2 steps and cannot reach any position with fruits.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5`
- `fruits[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= startPos, position_i <= 2 * 10^5`
- `position_{i-1} < position_i` for any `i > 0` (0-indexed)
- `1 <= amount_i <= 10^4`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 10^5`

## Hints

### Hint 1

Does an optimal path have very few patterns? For example, could a path that goes left, turns and goes right, then turns again and goes left be any better than a path that simply goes left, turns, and goes right?

### Hint 2

The optimal path turns at most once. That is, the optimal path is one of these: to go left only; to go right only; to go left, turn and go right; or to go right, turn and go left.

### Hint 3

Moving x steps left then k-x steps right gives you a range of positions that you can reach.

### Hint 4

Use prefix sums to get the sum of all fruits for each possible range.
