# Solutions — Richest Rising-Price Triplet I

## Fix the middle item with two prefix-maximum Fenwick passes

A valid triplet is fully determined by its middle item `j`: the first item
must be some `i < j` with `prices[i] < prices[j]`, and the third some
`k > j` with `prices[k] > prices[j]`, so the best triplet through `j` is
`profits[j]` plus the maximum profit on each of those two sides. Compress
the prices into ranks and sweep a Fenwick (binary indexed) tree of maximum
values left to right: before inserting item `j`, a prefix query over ranks
strictly below `prices[j]` yields `left[j]`, the best profit among earlier
cheaper items. A second, mirrored sweep right to left reuses the same
prefix queries over reversed ranks to fill `right[j]`, the best profit
among later pricier items. Both queries exclude equal ranks by construction,
which enforces the strict inequalities even when prices repeat.

Every profit is at least 1, so a query result of 0 certifies that no item
exists on that side, and item `j` contributes a candidate only when both
`left[j]` and `right[j]` are positive; the answer is the best candidate, or
`-1` when no item has both sides. Each of the two passes performs `O(n)`
Fenwick operations over `m <= n` ranks, and the final scan is linear.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` auxiliary space.
