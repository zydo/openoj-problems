# Solutions — Uniform Subtree Count

## Post-order depth-first search

Whether the subtree hanging from a node is uniform is decided entirely
below it: it holds exactly when both children's subtrees are themselves
uniform and every child that exists carries the node's own value.
Nothing a parent can do repairs a broken child, so the verdict only ever
flows upward — which makes post-order traversal the shape of the
problem itself. The code recurses into both children first, then judges
the node from the two returned booleans plus the children's values.

Each call answers one question — is the subtree rooted here uniform —
and every `true` handed upward is one more subtree for the count,
incremented on the spot. The recursion bottoms out on two base cases: a
leaf, whose one-node subtree is uniform by definition, and the empty
tree, which is reported as vacuously uniform because an absent child can
never break its parent — only a present child with the wrong value can.
That vacuous case is never counted, so an empty root returns `0` without
any special handling.

The one trap is short-circuiting: both children must be visited even
when the first already breaks this node, because the counting happens
inside the recursion and a skipped branch would silently skip its own
uniform subtrees. Both child results are evaluated into locals first, so
every node is visited exactly once no matter how mixed the tree is —
`[5,1,5,5,5,null,5]` still counts its three `5`-leaves plus the `5`-node
whose only present child is one of them, even though the root's own
verdict fails (its other child holds a `1`).

**Complexity:** `O(n)` time — each node is visited exactly once — and
`O(h)` space for the call stack, where `h` is the tree's height:
`O(log n)` for a balanced tree, `O(n)` worst case for a skewed chain (at
most 1000 nodes).
