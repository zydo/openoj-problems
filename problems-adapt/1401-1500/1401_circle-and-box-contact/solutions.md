# Solutions — Circle and Box Contact

## Closest point on the box to the circle center

The circle and the box overlap exactly when the box contains a point
whose distance from the circle's center is at most `radius`. If any such
point exists, the one closest to the center is certainly one of them, so
the whole test collapses to computing the distance from the center to
the nearest point of the box and comparing it with `radius`.

For an axis-aligned box that nearest point is found by clamping each
coordinate of the center into the box's interval: the nearest
x-coordinate is the middle value among `xCenter`, `x1`, and `x2`, and
likewise the nearest y-coordinate is the middle of `yCenter`, `y1`, and
`y2`. Clamping the two coordinates independently is valid precisely
because the shape is axis-aligned — for any point, the nearest point on
an axis-aligned box is obtained coordinate by coordinate.

When the center lies inside the box both clamps are the identity and
the distance is zero, so the comparison `distance² <= radius²` succeeds
there too; that also covers a center sitting exactly on an edge or a
corner. All arithmetic stays integral: the inputs are integers, and
comparing squared distances avoids both square roots and floating point,
so the answer is exact for every input.

**Complexity:** `O(1)` time, `O(1)` space.
