# Solutions — Crossing The Grid With Health To Spare

Both approaches price the crossing the same way: a step onto a `1` cell
costs one point, a step onto a `0` cell is free, both corners are entered,
and the crossing survives exactly when its cheapest corner-to-corner price
stays at most `health - 1`. Dijkstra with a binary heap computes that price
the textbook way — cells as nodes, side-adjacent moves as 0/1-weighted
edges, a min-heap settling cells in nondecreasing cost — and pays a log
factor for the privilege. The 0-1 BFS that closes the file keeps the same
relaxation but swaps the heap for a double-ended queue whose layer order
makes every operation constant, finishing the job in linear time.

## Dijkstra with a Binary Heap

Model the grid as a graph: every cell is a node, and each side-adjacent
step is a directed edge whose weight follows the safety rule — 1 when the
cell being entered is unsafe, 0 when it is safe. The cheapest crossing is
then an ordinary single-source shortest path from `(0, 0)`, and the
starting cell charging means `dist[0][0]` opens at `grid[0][0]` rather
than 0.

Dijkstra settles cells in nondecreasing cost: a min-heap of
`(cost, row, col)` candidates pops the cheapest unsettled cell first, and
non-negative weights make that pop final. A stale-entry guard skips
records whose cost no longer matches the cell's stored distance — lazily
discarded leftovers from better offers — and each of the four neighbors is
relaxed only when the route through the current cell strictly improves it.
The first time the bottom-right cell is popped, its cost is the minimum
number of unsafe cells any crossing enters, so the answer is whether that
cost stays within the `health - 1` budget and leaves the required positive
remainder.

**Complexity:** `O(mn log(mn))` time — every cell is relaxed O(4) times,
each heap operation paying a log factor; `O(mn)` space for the distance
matrix and heap.

## 0-1 BFS on the cheapest unsafe-cell count

Think of the crossing as paying one health point for every unsafe cell it
enters — and note that both endpoints are entered: the crossing begins by
stepping onto `(0, 0)` and ends by stepping onto `(m - 1, n - 1)`, so a
path's cost is the number of `1` cells on it, start and destination
included. The crossing survives exactly when some path costs at most
`health - 1`: spending that much leaves the required positive remainder.
Example 1 shows the boundary — with `health = 1` the budget is zero, so
only a fully safe path qualifies; Example 3 shows the endpoints charging,
where the best path pays for all four unsafe cells it touches (the center
is safe but every other cell of the grid, corners included, is not).

So compute, for every cell, the minimum number of unsafe cells entered on
any crossing from `(0, 0)` to it, then compare the value at the bottom-right
corner against `health - 1`. Edge moves cost 1 when the neighbor is
unsafe and 0 when it is safe — a shortest-path problem whose edge weights
are only 0 and 1, which is what 0-1 BFS exploits. A double-ended queue
holds frontier cells; popping from the front relaxes each neighbor and
pushes it back to the front when the move was free (same layer) or to the
back when it cost a point (next layer). Every cell therefore enters the
deque at most once per improved distance, distances are finalized in
nondecreasing order just as in Dijkstra, and the answer is whether the
destination's final distance stays within the budget. A plain BFS or a
binary heap both work too; the deque merely avoids the heap's log factor.

The numbers stay tiny: costs never exceed `m * n <= 2500`, so 32-bit
integers hold everything with room to spare.

**Complexity:** `O(mn)` time — every cell is relaxed O(4) times and deque
operations are constant; `O(mn)` space for the distance matrix and deque.
