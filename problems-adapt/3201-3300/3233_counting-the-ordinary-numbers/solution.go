// two (three divisors total forces the form prime^2), and 1 itself has
// none. The specials in [l, r] are therefore the squares of primes in
// [ceil(sqrt(l)), floor(sqrt(r))] — at most sqrt(10^9) ~ 31623
// candidates, counted with one sieve. Square roots start from math.Sqrt
// but are corrected with exact integer multiplies; the boundary squares
// are held in int64 explicitly, so rounding can never move a boundary.
