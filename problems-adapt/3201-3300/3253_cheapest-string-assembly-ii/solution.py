        # at most 50 words against a target of at most 2000 characters — so

        # ones), and an unreachable dp[n] is the -1 case. str.startswith
        # runs the match test without slicing and never reads past the end,
        # so words longer than the remaining suffix are rejected safely.

        # at most len(target) * max(cost) <= 2 * 10^8, which fits an int.
