# Solutions — Windows That Can Host A Pattern II

## Sliding window with two pointers and a fixed frequency table

A window can host word2 exactly when its character multiset covers word2's
multiset, so the task is to count, for every left end `l`, how many right
ends `r` produce a covering window. Coverage is monotone: if `[l, r]`
covers, `[l, r']` with `r' > r` covers too. That makes a two-pointer sweep
exact — advance a right pointer until the counts of all 26 letters first
satisfy `count[c] >= need[c]`, then every extension of that window also
hosts, contributing `n - r` windows for this left end.

The right pointer never moves backwards: after dropping the leftmost
character of a covered (or not-yet-covered) window, the smallest covering
right end can only stay put or grow, so across the whole scan each character
enters and leaves the window at most once and the run time stays linear in
`|word1|`. The bookkeeping is two length-26 integer arrays plus a running
tally of how many required characters are still missing, which is updated by
±1 per event; no per-character map or reallocation happens inside the loop,
which matters at the top of the constraint range (`|word1| = 10⁶`,
`|word2| = 10⁴`). The answer itself can approach `n(n+1)/2 ≈ 5 × 10¹¹`, well
past 32-bit range, so it is accumulated in a 64-bit integer throughout.

In JavaScript both strings fit easily and the count stays far below 2⁵³
(the maximum possible value is about `5.000005 × 10¹¹ < 9.007 × 10¹⁵`), so an
ordinary `number` accumulates the answer exactly — no BigInt needed. Every
other language uses its native 64-bit integer type for the total.

**Complexity:** `O(|word1| + |word2|)` time, `O(1)` space.
