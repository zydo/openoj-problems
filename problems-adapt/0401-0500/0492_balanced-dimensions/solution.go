// The best width is the largest divisor of area at or below its square root:
// every factorization pairs a divisor above the root with one below it, a
// larger W means a smaller L = area / W, and requirement 2 pins the answer to
// the below-root half — so the widest such W minimizes L - W while keeping
// L >= W. math.Sqrt is a float64, so settle the floor exactly first: starting
// below the root could skip a square's [s, s] pair, and starting above it
// could accept W > L (area 12 at width 4 gives [3, 4]).
