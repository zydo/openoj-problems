        # two child bits, 3 ANDs them — so the answer is a post-order
        # fold. Spines of this tree can run hundreds of nodes deep, so
        # the fold runs on explicit stacks instead of the call stack:
        # entries say either "expand this node" or "apply this
        # operator". Expanding an internal node parks its operator
        # beneath its children, left on top; because the tree is full,
        # each subtree's entries net out to exactly one bit, so an
        # operator resurfaces only after its two operands sit ready on
        # the operand shelf.
