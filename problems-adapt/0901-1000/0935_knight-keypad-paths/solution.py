        # counts[d] is the number of distinct numbers of the current length
        # that end on digit d. Every cell seeds one number of length 1, and
        # each pass pushes every count through the knight's hop list — a
        # number ending on d extends by one hop to each knight-neighbor of
        # d — so n - 1 passes grow the row to length n and the row sum is
        # the answer. Cell 5 has no knight-neighbor, so it seeds length 1
        # and never extends again.
