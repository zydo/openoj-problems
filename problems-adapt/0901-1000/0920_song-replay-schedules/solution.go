// pairwise distinct, because two occurrences of one song closer than k would
// already violate the window, so exactly min(k, j) used songs are blocked
// and max(0, j - k) remain, giving dp[i-1][j] * (j - k). Row i reads only
// row i-1, so one rolling row carries the table; the answer is dp[goal][n].
