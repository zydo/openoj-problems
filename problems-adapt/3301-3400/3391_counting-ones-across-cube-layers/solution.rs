// pairs; every count change pushes a fresh pair, so the top always
// holds the largest live count with ties broken toward the larger
// index, and pairs left stale by later changes are discarded only when
// they surface at the top. The cell grid answers set and unset in O(1)
// and keeps repeated sets or unsets from skewing the counts. Each call
// costs O(log) heap work. BinaryHeap is already a max-heap, so the
// pairs are stored as-is.
