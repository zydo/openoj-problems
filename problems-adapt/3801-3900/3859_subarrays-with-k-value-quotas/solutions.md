# Solutions — Subarrays With k Value Quotas

## Latest occurrences with a segment tree

Fix a right endpoint and order the distinct values by their latest occurrence,
from newest to oldest. A left endpoint produces exactly `k` distinct values
precisely when it is greater than the `(k + 1)`st latest position and no
greater than the `k`th latest position. For each of those top `k` values, it
also has frequency at least `m` precisely when the left endpoint is no greater
than that value's m-th latest occurrence.

A segment tree is keyed by latest positions. Its leaves store an active-value
count and the value's m-th latest position, so it can find the `k`th and
`(k + 1)`st active positions and take the minimum m-th latest position over
the top `k`. If these positions are `lastK`, `lastNext`, and `minM`, this
right endpoint contributes `max(0, min(lastK, minM) - lastNext)` subarrays.
Moving a value's leaf from its old latest position to the current position
takes logarithmic time.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space.
