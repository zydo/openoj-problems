# Solutions — Street Height Profile

## Sweep coordinate events

Only a building start or end can change the set of active heights. At each
start coordinate, record positive changes to the active height sum and active
count; at each end, record the corresponding negative changes. Sorting the
event coordinates then partitions the street into intervals with constant
coverage.

Apply the event at a coordinate before describing the interval to the next
coordinate. When the active count is positive, integer-divide the 64-bit active
height sum by that count. Extend the preceding output only when it ends at the
current coordinate and has the same average; requiring contiguity prevents an
uncovered gap from being merged away. Event coordinates are scanned in numeric
order, so the result is already left-to-right.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space.
