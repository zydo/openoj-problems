# Solutions — Three-Room Loops

## Orient edges and intersect forward neighbors

Compute every room's degree and order rooms by `(degree, id)`. Direct each corridor from the lower endpoint in that order to the higher endpoint. For every directed edge `u → v`, inspect `u`'s forward neighbors and count those also present in `v`'s forward-neighbor set. In a triangle, exactly its lowest-to-middle edge finds the highest room, so each cycle is counted once.

Degree ordering limits the number of forward neighbors any room can contribute to these intersections, avoiding a quadratic scan over all room triples even on dense inputs.

**Complexity:** `O(n + m√m)` time and `O(n + m)` space, where `m = corridors.length`.
