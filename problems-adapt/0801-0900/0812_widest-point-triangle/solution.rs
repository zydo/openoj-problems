// i < j < k keep the largest area. The area is half the absolute cross
// product of the edge vectors b - a and c - a, kept in exact integers
// until the single final division by 2 — a power of two, so the returned
// double is exact and a degenerate (collinear) triple simply contributes
// area 0.
