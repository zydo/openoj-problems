// The digits of the answer multiply to num, and a number with fewer digits
// is always smaller than one with more, so the smallest answer uses the
// fewest digits whose product is num, arranged ascending. Fewest digits is
// exactly what dividing by the largest digits first finds: 9 packs two 3s
// into one digit, 8 packs three 2s, and the sweep down to 2 ends with no
// two digits that could merge into one (2*2 -> 4, 2*3 -> 6, 2*4 -> 8,
// 3*3 -> 9), so the digit count is minimal — and grabbing the largest
// digits first also wins the ties among equally short factorizations, four
// 2s packing as 8*2 (28) rather than 4*4 (44). The divisions land the
// digits in descending order, so folding them back to front assembles the
// smallest arrangement.
