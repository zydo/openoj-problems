        # property of the multiset of values, whatever order a walk meets
        # them in. So this version takes the tree as an ordinary container
        # — a stack pops a node, tallies its value into a dict keyed by
        # the value itself, and pushes the children — and the dict, not
        # adjacency, does the bookkeeping. The walk stays iterative: the
        # tree may be a single 10^4-node chain, whose traversal would
        # nest 10000 calls — past CPython's default recursion limit.

        # One pass over the table finds the largest count; a second
        # collects every value that reaches it. A dict iterates in
        # arbitrary order — the ascending order the streak walk gets for
        # free from inorder is absent here — so the survivors are sorted
        # once at the end.
