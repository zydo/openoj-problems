// Deletion freedom reduces the subsequence to its value multiset: only how
// often each value occurs matters, never the order. The exactly-1 gap forces
// a neighbor-value pick onto the two values v and v + 1, and a count-map key
// occurs at least once, so looking up each key's successor is exactly the
// both-values-present test; the largest count(v) + count(v + 1) wins, 0 when
// no adjacent pair exists.
