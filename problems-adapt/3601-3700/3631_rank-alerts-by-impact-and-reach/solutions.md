# Solutions — Rank Alerts By Impact And Reach

The whole problem is the comparison key; everything else is the
platform sort.

## Composite-key sort

Each alert's score is `2 × impact + reach`, and the requested order is
score descending with ID ascending on ties. Computing both numbers per
comparison and sorting with that composite key — `(−score, ID)` as an
ascending key, or the mirrored pair of comparisons in the languages
with explicit comparators — produces the answer in one pass. Because
the IDs are unique, the order is total: no two distinct alerts compare
equal, so the output is identical for stable and unstable sorts alike.

The score peaks at `2 × 10⁹ + 10⁹ = 3×10⁹`, which overflows a signed
32-bit integer; the key therefore lives in 64-bit arithmetic (`long`,
`long long`, `int64`) and, in JavaScript, in plain `Number` values —
exact there since `3×10⁹ < 2⁵³`, provided the comparison stays on
floats rather than 32-bit integer ops.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` space (or `O(log n)`
recursion where the sort mutates in place).
