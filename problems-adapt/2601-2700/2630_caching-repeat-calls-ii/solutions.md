# Solutions — Caching Repeat Calls II

## Tree of Maps over the Argument Spine

The cache is a tree whose spine walks one argument position at a time.
Each level is a `Map` holding that position's already-seen branches, and a
fully consumed argument list parks its result under a private leaf symbol.
A replay descends as far as its tuple reaches: primitives sit directly
under their own value (a `Map` compares keys exactly like `===`, keeping
`1`, `"1"` and `true` apart while treating `+0` and `-0` alike), and every
object occurrence sits under a `Symbol` minted once per reference through
a `WeakMap`. Structural twins therefore stay distinct — Example 2's fresh
array literals never hit — while the shared references of Example 3
collapse onto one branch after their first call.

The judged replay wraps `fn` in a counter before handing it to this
caching wrapper, so each pass through the wrapper marks one genuine
invocation and every row records the running total with its value. Because
only an exact miss descends to `fn`, a warm branch short-circuits without
touching the wrapped function at all, which is precisely what the `calls`
column observes: duplicate-heavy replays freeze at their first count,
distinct-heavy replays climb by one per row. Symbol keys can never collide
with primitive map keys (`5` versus the symbol naming object #5 live in
disjoint key spaces), so no aliasing across argument types is possible.

**Complexity:** `O(A)` time for a replay of `A` total arguments (each
argument lands in exactly one map operation), `O(A)` space.
