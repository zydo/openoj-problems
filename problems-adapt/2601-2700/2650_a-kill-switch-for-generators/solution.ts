// abortable drives the generator over two channels: values resolved by
// yielded promises flow back through generator.next(value), and both
// promise rejections and the cancel signal flow through
// generator.throw(error). Everything routes through one stepper; wrapping
// only the raw generator call means an error thrown into a generator that
// never catches it lands here and rejects the returned promise, while a
// caught one keeps the loop going from the next yield. The settled flag
// freezes the fate after resolve/reject fires, so cancelling an already
// finished generator (Example 1) is inert instead of throwing into a done
// generator.
