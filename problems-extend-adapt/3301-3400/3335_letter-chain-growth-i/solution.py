        # count) and splits every z into an a and a b: after the shift the
        # new counts[0] is the old z-count, and the old a-count gains the
        # old z-count on top. Reducing counts[1] below MOD per sweep keeps
        # every entry below MOD forever. A Python slice rotation runs the
        # shift at C speed, so t sweeps cost t list operations.
