# Solutions — Sweeping Out Suspect Methods

Two facts decide the answer. First, the suspicious group is exactly the
set of methods reachable from `k` along invocation edges, so one
traversal over the forward graph marks it. Second, the group may only be
removed when no method outside it invokes into it — a single outside
invocation of any suspicious method blocks the whole removal.

## Reachability scan with an iterative traversal

Build the forward adjacency of `invocations` and mark the suspicious
group with an iterative DFS from `k` (an explicit stack, since a
`10⁵`-long invocation chain would overflow the recursion limits of the
judged runtimes). Then scan the edge list once: if any edge runs from a
non-suspicious tail to a suspicious head, some outside method invokes
into the group, and the answer is every method `0 .. n - 1`. Otherwise
the removal goes through, and the answer is every method the traversal
did not mark, emitted in ascending order.

Both passes are linear over the graph, so even the maximum shape —
`n = 10⁵` methods and `2 * 10⁵` invocations — is a single linear sweep
per structure. A BFS frontier instead of the DFS stack, or scanning the
reverse adjacency to detect the outside feeders, produces the same
partition; the edge scan after the traversal is the cheapest way to
apply the "no outside invoker" rule because it needs no extra bookkeeping
beyond the suspicious marks it already has.

**Complexity:** `O(n + m)` time, `O(n + m)` space.
