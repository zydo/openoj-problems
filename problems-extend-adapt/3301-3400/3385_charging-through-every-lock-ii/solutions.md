# Solutions — Charging Through Every Lock II

The blade's charge factor depends only on how many locks have been broken
so far, so if lock `i` is broken `k`-th, it is charged at factor `k`: its
stored energy grows 0, k, 2k, ... each minute and it breaks after exactly
`ceil(strength[i] / k)` minutes. Waiting beyond that moment only wastes
time (energy resets on every break and the factor never changes between
breaks), so a break order π costs exactly `sum over k of
ceil(strength[π(k)] / k)`, and the task is to choose the order minimizing
that sum.

## Hungarian algorithm (minimum-cost matching)

Build the n×n cost matrix `cost[i][j] = ceil(strength[i] / (j+1))` — the
time to break lock `i` if it is the `(j+1)`-th lock broken. The answer is
the minimum-cost perfect assignment between locks and positions, which is
exactly what the Hungarian algorithm with potentials computes in `O(n³)`:
each round grows a shortest-alternating-tree from an unmatched row,
adjusting the dual variables `u`, `v` by the tightest slack delta so at
least one new edge becomes tight, then augments along the tree through
the `way[]` parent pointers. After all `n` rounds the matched column of
each row is read off `p[]`, and the matched costs sum to the minimum
total time. `n ≤ 80` keeps each round at `O(n²)` edge relaxations, so the
whole run is a few hundred thousand operations.

**Complexity:** `O(n³)` time, `O(n²)` space.
