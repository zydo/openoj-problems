// which is even exactly when BOTH neighbors are even — so k-even means
// exactly k adjacent pairs have both elements even. With E = m/2 (floor)
// even values and O = m - E odd values, track per length i, for each pair
// count j, how many arrays end in an even value and how many end in an
// odd one. Extending by an even value (E choices) lifts an even-ending
// j-1-pair state to j pairs and leaves odd-ending states in place;
// extending by an odd value (O choices) never changes the count. Entries
// stay below MOD, so every join multiplies a value below 2 * MOD by at
// most 500 — about 10^12, kept in i64.
