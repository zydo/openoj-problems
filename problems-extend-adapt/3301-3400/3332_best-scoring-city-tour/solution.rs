// dp[j] is the best score after the processed days with the tourist in
// city j; every city starts at 0, which encodes the free choice of the
// starting city. Each day, city j is either stayed in
// (dp[j] + stayScore[i][j]) or reached by a move c -> j
// (dp[c] + travelScore[c][j]). The c == j term is a 0-point no-op
// (travelScore[i][i] == 0); keeping it inside the max is harmless, since
// replacing a no-op day with a stay never lowers the score.
