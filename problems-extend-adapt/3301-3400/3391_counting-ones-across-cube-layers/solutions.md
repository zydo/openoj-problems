# Solutions — Counting Ones Across Cube Layers

Each layer's one-count is a single number, so the state worth maintaining
is tiny: an array of `n` counts plus a structure that can answer "which
layer currently has the most ones, ties broken toward the larger index"
after every count change. The cell grid itself is still needed to make
`setCell` and `unsetCell` exact — setting a cell that is already 1, or
unsetting one that is already 0, must not skew any count.

## Count array plus lazy-deletion max-heap

Keep the `n` layer counts in an array and a max-heap of `(count, x)`
pairs. Every count change pushes one fresh pair for the layer's new
count, so at any moment the heap contains a live pair for every layer —
the top is the largest current count, and because `x` is the secondary
key, ties break toward the largest index. Pairs pushed by earlier states
become stale as counts move; a stale pair is indistinguishable by value,
but it is harmless: `densestLayer` discards top entries whose count no
longer matches the array and reads off the first pair that agrees. The
live pair of the true maximum always sits somewhere below the stale
ones, so the discard loop always terminates. The constructor seeds one
`(0, x)` pair per layer so the heap is never empty and a query before
any set answers `n − 1`.

`setCell` and `unsetCell` consult an `n × n × n` cell grid first and do
nothing when the requested transition is a no-op, which keeps the counts
honest; otherwise they flip the cell, adjust the count, and push one
pair. Every operation is `O(log)` heap work on a heap of at most
`n + 10⁵` pairs, comfortably inside the limits at `n ≤ 100` and `10⁵`
calls.

**Complexity:** `O(log(n + m))` per call, `O(n² + n + m)` space, where
`m` is the number of set/unset calls made so far.
