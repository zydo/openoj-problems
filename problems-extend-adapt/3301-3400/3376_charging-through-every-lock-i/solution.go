// works: best[mask] is the minimum minutes to break exactly the locks in
// mask, and each unbroken lock i extends mask at the cost of one ceil
// division by the next slot's factor 1 + popcount*k. Every mask is finite
// before it is processed (its submasks come first), so MaxInt never
// overflows. n <= 8 keeps this at a few thousand moves.
