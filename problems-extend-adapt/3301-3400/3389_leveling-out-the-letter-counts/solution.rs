impl Solution {
    // Only the letter counts matter; a good string has every count at
    // 0 or at some common target c, and c never needs to exceed the
    // largest count. For a fixed c each letter either keeps c copies
    // (cost |occ-c|) or is deleted out (cost occ). One refinement: a
    // unit in the letter just left of a kept letter that still needs
    // copies can change into it instead — the hop replaces the delete
    // the unit would pay anyway and saves an insert, worth 1 per unit,
    // up to how many spare units the left letter has and how many
    // copies the right letter still needs. Those flows only run between
    // adjacent letters, so one pass over the alphabet carrying the
    // previous letter's choice (kept or emptied) prices each target;
    // the answer is the cheapest target.
