# Solutions — Top Value From Two Disjoint Events

## Start-time order and suffix maxima

Sort the events by start time and build a suffix array where each position stores the greatest event value from that position onward. For each event, binary-search for the first later event whose start is strictly greater than the current inclusive end; the suffix maximum there is the best compatible second choice.

Combine the current value with that compatible suffix maximum and compare it with the best result so far. Keeping the current value as a candidate by itself handles cases where every pair overlaps or one event is worth more than any compatible pair.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time and `O(n)` space.
