# Solutions — Letter-for-Letter Dominance

## Sort both and compare rank by rank

Which rearrangement to try needs no search. If any permutation of `x`
can dominate any permutation of `y`, then sorting both strings
alphabetically and comparing position by position is the strongest
pairing on both sides: the sorted order of `x` is the coordinate-wise
weakest arrangement `x` can offer, and the sorted order of `y` is the
coordinate-wise strongest, so the sorted-vs-sorted comparison succeeds
exactly when some pair of permutations succeeds. Sorting therefore
loses nothing and turns an exponential search into one linear check.

The remaining work is symmetric: compute `sorted(s1)` and `sorted(s2)`,
test whether the first dominates the second element-wise, test the
reverse, and answer the disjunction. Sorting costs `O(n log n)` (a
26-bucket counting sort would make it `O(n)`, an easy refinement given
the lowercase alphabet); both dominance scans are `O(n)`.

On `"tap"` versus `"cat"` the sorted pair is `apt` vs `act`, and `apt >=
act` position by position, so the answer is true.

**Complexity:** `O(n log n)` time with comparison sorting (or `O(n)` with
counting sort), `O(n)` space for the sorted copies.
