// Each operation sends one '1' across one whole block of 0's, stopping
// at the next '1' or the end. A pair — a '1' with a block of 0's
// opening strictly to its right — is spent at most once, because 0's
// never move and a landed '1' stays past them forever; always taking
// the lowest legal index spends every such pair exactly once. The
// answer is therefore just the number of these pairs: sweeping left
// to right, whenever a fresh block of 0's opens, every '1' seen so
// far sits to its left and contributes exactly one operation.
