// target[:i], dp[0] is 0, and every reachable position extends each
// DISTINCT word matching its next characters. Duplicate words first
// collapse to their cheapest occurrence. The Easy bounds are small —
// at most 50 words against a target of at most 2000 characters — so
// a direct scan of all words at all positions suffices; greedy
// longest-match fails (a pricey long word can block cheaper short
// ones), and an unreachable dp[n] is the -1 case. The i+len(word) <= n
// bound rejects words longer than the remaining suffix; HasPrefix never
// reads past either string. Costs accumulate in int64 room even though
// any achievable cost is at most len(target) * max(cost) = 2 * 10^8,
// which fits an int.
