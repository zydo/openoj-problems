        # by the singleton subarrays — binomial coefficients mod 2 decide
        # which elements reach the final XOR. On top of the score rows we
        # fold a running maximum: best[l][r], the largest score of any
        # subarray inside [l..r], splits by endpoints into
        # max(score[l][r], best[l][r-1], best[l+1][r]) — any such subarray

        # itself. Rows are built for l = n-1 down to 0, keeping only the
        # previous score row while every finished best row is stored, so
        # a query is one lookup into its left endpoint's row: O(n^2 + q)
        # time and O(n^2) stored cells (~8 MB of 4-byte cells at n=2000).

        # the XOR of two bit-31-zero words has bit 31 zero too — by
        # induction every score lies in [0, 2^31 - 1], so the 4-byte
        # array cells never overflow.
