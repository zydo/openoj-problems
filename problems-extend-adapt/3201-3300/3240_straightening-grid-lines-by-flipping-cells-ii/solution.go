// Reflections in both axes partition the cells into orbits that must end
// uniform: quadrant quadruples, pairs along the middle row/column of odd
// dimensions, and the lone center when both are odd. Price each orbit at
// its cheaper value, then settle the count of 1s modulo 4 over the small
// orbits: a quadruple holds a multiple of four 1s either way, a finished
// pair two, the center one — so the center always clears to 0 (2t + 1 is
// odd) and the pairs parked at 1 must be even in number. A split pair
// re-tunes between equal-cost states for free; otherwise one uniform pair
// pays 2 to switch to its dearer value.
