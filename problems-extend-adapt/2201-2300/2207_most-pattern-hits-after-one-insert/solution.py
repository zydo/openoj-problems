        # very front of text, and an inserted pattern[1] with the most
        # pattern[0]'s at the very end — any interior spot sees only a
        # subset of one of those sides. So the answer is the pairs already
        # in text plus the larger of the two letter counts, and one sweep
        # gathers all three numbers: each pattern[1] is charged with the
        # pattern[0]'s before it. When both pattern letters are equal the
        # same sweep yields k*(k-1)/2 pairs plus a gain of k, which is
        # exactly what one extra copy of that letter adds.
