        # therefore counted in two slope buckets; hashing segments by
        # diagonal midpoint (excluding equal-slope pairs, i.e. collinear
        # quadruples) counts each parallelogram exactly once, so one
        # subtraction makes every convex quad with parallel sides count
        # once. Bucket counts reach C(125000, 2) ~ 7.8e9, so 64-bit math.
