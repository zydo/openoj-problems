	// subarray as early as possible never removes an opportunity a later
	// close would have had — it can only free up more room for subarrays
	// after it. `prefixSum` is int64: up to 10^5 terms each up to 10^4 in
	// magnitude can sum to roughly 10^9, close enough to the int32 range to
	// be worth avoiding.
