        # element never costs more. Sliding a window [l, r] rightward, the
        # cheapest way to flatten it is to raise everything to the median
        # nums[(l + r) // 2], costing (median * left_count - left_sum) +
        # (right_sum - median * right_count) via prefix sums. The cost only
        # shrinks when the window shrinks, so l never moves backwards.
        # Costs reach n * span / 2 ~ 5 * 10^13 and k reaches 10^14: 64-bit
        # accumulators in the typed languages, and every intermediate stays
        # below 2^53, so JavaScript numbers remain exact.
