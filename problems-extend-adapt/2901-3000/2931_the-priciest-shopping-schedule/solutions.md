# Solutions — The Priciest Shopping Schedule

The buying rule makes each stall behave like a deck dealt from the cheap
end: because every row is non-increasing, the cheapest item a stall still
offers is always its rightmost unbought one, and buying it exposes only
the next item up. So the whole schedule is a sequence of "which stall's
tail do I take today" choices, and the price multiplier grows with the
day — expensive days must be reserved for expensive items.

## Buy the cheapest tail each day

Every item must be bought on some day 1..m·n, so maximizing spending means
pairing large values with large day numbers. The greedy pairing is
optimal by an exchange argument: in any schedule, if a cheaper item was
bought on a later day than a more expensive one, swapping those two days'
purchases is still legal (each stall's tail discipline is unaffected by
when the other stall bought) and changes the total by
`(expensive − cheap) × (later − earlier) ≥ 0`. Repeating the swap untangles
any schedule into the sorted one. Feasibility comes free: the globally
cheapest unbought item is always some stall's rightmost item, since within
a stall values only shrink toward the tail.

The simulation walks days 1..m·n, each time taking the minimum of the m
current tails, crediting `value × day`, and advancing that stall's tail. A
min-heap over the stalls does each step in O(log m) — with m ≤ 10 even a
plain scan over the tails is equivalent, which the JavaScript and
TypeScript versions use. The total is bounded by
10⁶ × (10⁵)(10⁵ + 1)/2 = 5.00005 × 10¹⁵, which needs 64-bit accumulators
in the typed languages and stays below 2⁵³, so JavaScript numbers remain
exact.

**Complexity:** `O(m · n · log m)` time, `O(m)` space.
