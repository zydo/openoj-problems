/**
 * dp[i] = cheapest way to acquire everything from fruit i onward when
 * fruit i itself is purchased. Buying fruit i makes fruits i+1..2i+1
 * free, so if that reaches the end dp[i] = prices[i]; otherwise the next
 * purchase lands on some j in [i+1, 2i+2] and dp[i] = prices[i] +
 * min(dp[j]). Sweeping i right to left, that window's edges only move
 * left, so a monotonic window supplies the minimum in O(1): win holds
 * candidate indices, oldest first, with dp values non-decreasing toward
 * the newest. All costs are exact doubles (sums <= 10^8).
 * @param {number[]} prices
