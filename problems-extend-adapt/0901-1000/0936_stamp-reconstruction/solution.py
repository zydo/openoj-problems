        # stamp counterpart or is already '?', because the last stamp to
        # cover a position always leaves the stamp's own letter there. Each
        # round takes the leftmost erasable window that still contains a
        # letter — erasing it can never block the remaining windows, since
        # turning letters into '?' only widens what matches — and blanks it.
        # A round that finds nothing while letters remain proves the target
        # unreachable; reversing the recorded indices yields the stamping
        # order.
