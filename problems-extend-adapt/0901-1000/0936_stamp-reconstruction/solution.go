// Work backwards from target, where stamping forwards becomes erasing: a
// window is erasable once every character in it either equals its stamp
// counterpart or is already '?', because the last stamp to cover a position
// always leaves the stamp's own letter there. Each round takes the leftmost
// erasable window that still contains a letter — erasing it can never block
// the remaining windows, since turning letters into '?' only widens what
// matches — and blanks it. A round that finds nothing while letters remain
// proves the target unreachable; reversing the recorded indices yields the
// stamping order.
