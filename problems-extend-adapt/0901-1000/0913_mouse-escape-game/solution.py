        # and the game is finite. Evaluate positions backward from the
        # terminals: the mouse at the hole is a mouse win, the cat on the
        # mouse a cat win. A position whose mover reaches any marked
        # successor carrying its own win takes that mark immediately; once
        # its last undecided successor falls, every move leads to the
        # opponent's win and the position takes the opponent's mark. The
        # cat's moves skip the hole. Whatever stays unmarked at the fixpoint
        # is a draw — a player that cannot force a win keeps play cycling
        # until a position repeats. The queue is iterative, and the answer
        # is the mark of the initial position (mouse at 1, cat at 2, mouse
        # to move).
