// a parallelogram, and equal diagonals make a parallelogram rectangular.
// So every pair of points is hashed as a candidate diagonal, and a match
// hands over both diagonals of a rectangle whose four corners are all
// present. The doubled midpoint (x1 + x2, y1 + y2) — integral even when
// the true midpoint is half-integral — packs into one int64 key as
// (x1 + x2) * 80001 + (y1 + y2); the squared diagonal length rides along
// inside each bucket entry.
