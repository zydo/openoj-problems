// The rules ask for the longest stretch of trees holding at most two fruit
// types: two baskets, one type each, one fruit from every tree picked while
// moving right. A sliding window over a type->count map maintains exactly
// that — extend the right edge tree by tree, and whenever a third type
// enters, retire trees from the left until one type's count reaches zero and
// drops out. The window then always spans the longest legal picking trip
// ending at the current tree, so its length contests the answer at every step.
