# Solutions — K-th Surviving Even

Dividing every positive even integer by two turns the infinite sequence into
the positive integers. Only even values in the queried subarray remove entries
from that sequence.

## Adjusted removed values

Collect each even value as its half-value `value` together with its original
array position. For a query, binary search the positions to isolate the
removed values belonging to `[l, r]`. If this slice starts at global removed
index `first`, its local item `j - first` is crossed by the answer exactly when
`value[j] <= k + j - first`, or equivalently
`value[j] - j <= k - first`. The precomputed sequence `value[j] - j` is
non-decreasing, so one more binary search counts all crossed removals. Adding
that count to `k` gives the missing half-value, which is doubled for the
answer.

At most `10⁵` values can be removed, so the largest result is
`2 * (10⁹ + 10⁵) = 2,000,200,000`, within signed 32-bit range and far below
JavaScript's `2⁵³` exact-integer limit.

**Complexity:** `O(n + q log n)` time, `O(n + q)` space including the output.
