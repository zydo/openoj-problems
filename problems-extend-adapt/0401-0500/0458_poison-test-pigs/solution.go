// The budget fits minutesToTest / minutesToDie feeding rounds — a partial
// extra wait never reaches a death — and through those rounds plus final
// survival each pig lands in exactly one of rounds + 1 states: it dies in
// round 1..rounds, or never. p pigs are then p digits of a base-
// (rounds + 1) number whose outcome vectors cover (rounds + 1)^p buckets,
// and by counting fewer pigs cannot. The answer is the smallest p whose
// coverage reaches buckets; buckets = 1 starts covered, needing 0 pigs.
// Multiplying out (never a floating log) keeps power boundaries like
// 512 = 2^9 versus 513 exact; buckets <= 1000 caps the loop at ten steps,
// and the running product stays below buckets * states <= 101000, far
// inside every int here.
