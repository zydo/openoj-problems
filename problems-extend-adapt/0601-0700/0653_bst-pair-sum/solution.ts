    // that reaches every node sees one member of a summing pair before
    // the other, so a plain preorder returns true at the first hit and
    // false only after the whole tree is exhausted. The walk carries its
    // own stack of nodes: the tree may be a single 10^4-node chain, whose
    // walk would nest 10000 calls — over the 512k V8 stack this judge
    // runs Node with — so every runtime iterates instead.
