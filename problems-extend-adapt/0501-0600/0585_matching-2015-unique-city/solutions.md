# Solutions — Matching 2015, Unique City

## Grouped keys as filters, then one sum

The two qualifying conditions are properties of the whole table, not of
any one row, so the query builds each as a grouped set first.
`GROUP BY total_2015` with `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` collects the 2015 values
that two or more policyholders share; `GROUP BY latitude, longitude` with
`HAVING COUNT(*) = 1` collects the location pairs that belong to exactly
one policyholder. The location must group as a pair: two policyholders at
the same latitude but different longitudes are in different cities, so
grouping on `latitude` alone would wrongly read their cities as shared.

The joins are the filter. `Policy p JOIN shared_2015 s ON
p.total_2015 = s.total_2015` drops every policyholder whose 2015 value
nobody else holds, and `JOIN unique_city u ON p.latitude = u.latitude AND
p.longitude = u.longitude` drops every one whose location pair somebody
else also holds — inner joins, because a row failing either test should
vanish rather than survive null-padded the way an outer join would keep
it. Each CTE carries one row per value or pair, so every policyholder
matches at most once on each side and the surviving rows are never
duplicated into the sum. What is left is `ROUND(SUM(p.total_2016), 2)`:
the sum runs over the REAL column, and `ROUND` takes it to two decimals
with ties going away from zero on the stored binary value — exactly
`45.125` rounds up to `45.13`, while a decimal `2.675` is stored a hair
below the half and stays `2.67`. When nothing qualifies the aggregate
still emits its one row: the sum of no rows is null.

Two aggregation passes over the `N` policyholders materialize the two key
sets. SQLite typically raises an automatic index over each materialized
CTE, resolving every row's two probes in constant time; with no index at
all the engine could nested-loop the join at `O(N^2)` comparisons.

**Complexity:** `O(N)` time, `O(N)` space.
