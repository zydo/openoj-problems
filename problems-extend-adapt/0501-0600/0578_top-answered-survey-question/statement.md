## Description

Table: `PollLog`

| Column Name | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| id          | int  |
| action      | enum |
| prompt_id   | int  |
| response_id | int  |
| seq_num     | int  |
| event_time  | int  |

This table may contain duplicate rows. `action` is an ENUM (category) of
the type: "show", "answer", or "skip". Each row of this table indicates
the user with ID = `id` has taken an action with the question
`prompt_id` at time `event_time`. If the action taken by the user is
"answer", `response_id` will contain the id of that answer, otherwise, it
will be null. `seq_num` is the numeral order of the question in the
current session.

The answer rate for a question is the number of times a user answered the
question divided by the number of times a user was shown the question.

Write a solution to report the question that has the highest answer rate.
If multiple questions have the same maximum answer rate, report the
question with the smallest `prompt_id`.

Each testcase supplies its own `dataset`: the DDL seeds the `PollLog`
table with that testcase's rows. A question that was never shown has no
answer rate — there is nothing to divide by — so it never carries the
highest one. The result format is in the following example.

### Example 1

```text
Input: PollLog table from the dataset below.
Output:
poll_id
200
Explanation: question 100 was shown 2 times and answered 1 time. Its
answer rate is 0.5. Question 200 was shown 1 time and answered 1 time.
Its answer rate is 1.0. Question 200 has the highest answer rate.
```

Write your solution as a single `SELECT` query returning one column,
`poll_id` — the `prompt_id` of the question with the highest answer
rate.

## Hints

### Hint 1

One group per question: `GROUP BY prompt_id` collapses the log, and each
row contributes exactly one counted term —
`SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'show' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` and its `'answer'`
twin tally the denominator and the numerator, so a skip adds to neither
sum and a duplicated row counts once per copy.

### Hint 2

The rate is a ratio, and SQLite's integer `/` truncates (`1/2` evaluates
to `0`, flattening every rate below `1`): multiply the answer tally by
`1.0` for a real quotient. `ORDER BY` that quotient `DESC` with
`prompt_id` as the second key and `LIMIT 1` implements
highest-rate-then-smallest-id; equal quotients — `1/2` and `2/4`, or
`1/3` and `2/6` — are equal as doubles, so a true tie reaches the id
tiebreak.

### Hint 3

A question with answers but zero shows divides by zero — its rate is
undefined, not infinite: `HAVING` on the show tally (or any filter
keeping only shown questions) removes those groups before the ranking,
so they neither win nor disturb the ordering.
