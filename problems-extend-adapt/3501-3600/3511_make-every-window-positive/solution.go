// and more than four untouched elements of magnitude 1e9 combined).
// The first endpoint with a non-positive window must be replaced at
// that endpoint itself — the earliest-ending bad window is best
// stabbed at its rightmost slot — and the new value also fixes every
// other bad window containing this slot.
