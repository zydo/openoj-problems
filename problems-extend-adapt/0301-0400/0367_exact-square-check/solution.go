// Squares march upward in lockstep — 1, 4, 9, 16, … — the map r -> r * r
// is strictly increasing over the positives, so "is num a perfect square"
// asks whether one sorted row contains num, and a sorted row is exactly
// what binary search interrogates. Keep the root candidates in lo..hi
// (starting 1..num — a root never exceeds its own number), square each
// midpoint, and move lo above a probe that fell short or hi below one
// that overshot. An empty interval means no root; only an exact hit ever
// returned true. Go's int is 64 bits on every platform the judge runs, so
// mid * mid has headroom: the widest probe squares to ~1.15 × 10¹⁸ against
// a ~9.2 × 10¹⁸ ceiling.
