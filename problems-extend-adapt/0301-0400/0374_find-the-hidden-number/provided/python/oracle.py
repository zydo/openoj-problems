"""The guess API (problem-provided oracle).

Ships with the problem, assembled into every submission's namespace by
the judge, never editable in the editor: `compareGuess(num)` reports how the
number it was given compares to the case's hidden pick — above it, below
it, or exactly it. This file is the implementation; solvers see only the
public API documented in the starter.
