class Solution:
    def columnNumber(self, letters: str) -> int:
        # Bijective base-26, decode side: each letter is a digit worth 1..26,
        # so Horner's rule folds the title with no off-by-one repair.
        number = 0
        for letter in letters:
            # Shift the digits so far one place left, then add this one.
            number = number * 26 + (ord(letter) - ord("A") + 1)
        # The "FXSHRXW" ceiling is exactly 2**31 - 1, so the fold stays in range.
        return number
