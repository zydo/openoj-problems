# Solutions — Balanced Tree From A Sorted Array

## Recursive midpoint split

A sorted array is already an inorder walk of the tree to be built, so the build is pure divide and
conquer: the middle element of a segment becomes the subtree's root, everything before it falls in
the left subtree, everything after in the right. Both required properties then come for free — the
BST ordering because in a sorted segment the middle separates strictly smaller from strictly larger
values, and the height balance because each side of the middle is at most one element shorter than
its sibling, so sibling subtree heights never differ by more than one at any node.

Because the judge compares the returned tree exactly rather than just checking its properties, the
one free choice left — which of two middles roots an even-length segment — is pinned to the second:
`mid = (lo + hi + 1) // 2` over the closed segment `[lo, hi]`. That tie-break is what reproduces
the examples' outputs, e.g. `[1,3]` roots at 3, not 1. Recursion is safe at the `10⁴` ceiling for
a reason worth stating: the balance is structural, not checked afterwards, so every recursion level
at least halves the segment and the depth is `ceil(log2 n)` — at most 14 frames, nowhere near any
language's call-stack limit. The input array can never produce a skewed tree, because the split
itself is what fixes each subtree's shape.

**Complexity:** `O(n)` time — each element becomes exactly one node — and `O(log n)` stack space
beside the `O(n)` tree being returned.
