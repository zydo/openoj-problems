// Splitting is only ever worth it to make a negative element flip sign,
// and a subarray forces alternating signs from its head — so per element
// there are two states: it keeps its phase-plus sign (free to continue or
// restart after a worst-so-far prefix) or it rides in as negated, which
// requires the previous element to have kept its sign. The seeds are
// exactly hint dp[1][*]; two rolling variables carry the table.
