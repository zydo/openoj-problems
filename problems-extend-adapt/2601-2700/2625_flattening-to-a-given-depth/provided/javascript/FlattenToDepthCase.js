// Problem-provided driver for 2625 flattening-to-a-given-depth. Assembled

// editable in the editor. This file is the hidden implementation — solvers
// see only the public API documented in the statement.
//
// The driver owns one case's nested array and depth (the same shape as the
// statement's Input). drive() receives the submission's flattenToDepth function and
// calls it exactly once with (.arr, .n); the returned array is validated to
// be an array and recorded as this case's judged output.

    // construct values (arr, n) plus the query budget (unused — one judged
    // call per case needs no call accounting).

        void budget;
