// bundle-provided case carrier for this problem (not editable here; the
// judge assembles this source into every submission):
//   TailProbe carries one case's array (.nums, the JSON.parse output the
//   statement speaks of). collect() is called by solve() AFTER the
//   submission has enhanced Array.prototype; it validates the enhancement
//   against fresh probe arrays of its own, so a submission that never
//   defined last (or faked it as an own property of the case array alone)
//   dies right here. verdict() is read after solve returns and reports
//   three probes — the case array itself, an untouched clone of it, and
//   an empty array — which is the judged transcript
//   ([liveLast, cloneLast, emptyLast]).
