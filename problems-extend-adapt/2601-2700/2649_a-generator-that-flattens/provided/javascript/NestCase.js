// Problem-provided driver for 2649 nested-array-generator. Assembled
// into every submission by the judge ahead of the submitted code; never
// editable in the editor. This file is the hidden implementation — solvers
// see only the public API documented in the statement.
//
// The driver owns one case's multi-dimensional array (the same shape as
// the statement's Input). drive() receives the submission's generator
// function and calls it exactly once with .arr; it then pumps the returned
// generator object with .next() until it reports done, recording every
// yielded integer in arrival order as this case's judged output.

class NestCase {
    // The interactive wrapper hands the oracle one array of the manifest's
    // construct values (arr) plus the query budget (unused — one judged
    // pump per case needs no call accounting).
    constructor([arr], budget) {
        void budget;
        this.arr = arr;
        this.output = null;
    }

    // Run the submission's traversal against this case's input. A sync
    // generator settles entirely within the call, so plain iteration is
    // enough — no timers or microtask scheduling involved.
    drive(yieldFlatFn) {
        if (typeof yieldFlatFn !== "function") {
            throw new Error("drive expects the submission's yieldFlat function");

        }
        const yielded = [];
        for (;;) {
            const step = generator.next();
            if (step.done) break;
