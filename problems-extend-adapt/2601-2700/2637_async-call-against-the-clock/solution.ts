// withDeadline(fn, t) hands back a wrapper that captures t; each call to
// the wrapper starts fn immediately (so an immediate rejection or a
// synchronous throw claims the race the moment it happens) and returns
// a brand-new promise in which a timer scheduled for exactly t rejects
// with "Time Limit Exceeded". Whichever settles first wins — Promise
// semantics make the second settlement call a no-op, so no extra
// bookkeeping is needed to decide the winner — and both handlers route
// into that single promise's resolve/reject pair.
