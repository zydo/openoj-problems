# Solutions — Zigzag Column Fill

## Prototype enhancement with index math

The array enhancement itself lives on `Array.prototype` as
`zigzagColumns`: given `rowsCount` and `colsCount`, every source element
at linear index i lands in a cell computed without any mutable cursor.
The column is `i / rowsCount`; inside that column the offset `i %
rowsCount` runs top-to-bottom on even columns and bottom-to-top
(`rowsCount - 1 - offset`) on odd ones. Writing each value straight into
its final cell keeps one pass over the data; an empty result matrix
rows-first allocation makes the fill order irrelevant. Validity is a
single guard — any case where `rowsCount * colsCount !== nums.length`
renders `[]`, including empty inputs, because no positive product can
match length zero.

The judged entry point stays a one-liner: it receives the plain typed
array from the wire and simply invokes the freshly enhanced
`nums.zigzagColumns(rowsCount, colsCount)`. TypeScript gets the same
behavior by merging `zigzagColumns` into the global `Array` interface
before the method is assigned, so the delegated call typechecks against
the merge.

**Complexity:** `O(n)` time, `O(n)` space for the output grid.
