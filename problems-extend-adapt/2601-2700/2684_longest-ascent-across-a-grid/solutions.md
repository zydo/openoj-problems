# Solutions — Longest Ascent Across A Grid

## Reachable-rows frontier sweep

Every step advances exactly one column, so a walk's step count is simply
the index of the farthest column it reaches. Which row you would land on
in a later column only depends on which rows were reachable in the
previous one, so a single boolean array of size m can carry the whole
state: it starts all-true (any first-column cell is a valid start), and
each step computes the rows reachable in the next column by testing the
three neighbors of every reachable row for a strictly larger value.

If a step produces no reachable row the sweep stops early — no start can
push past that column — otherwise the step count grows by one and the new
array becomes the frontier. The answer is the accumulated count, which is
at most n - 1.

**Complexity:** `O(m * n)` time, `O(m)` space.
