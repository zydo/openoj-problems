	// gap it is dropped into counts the elements greater than it. The
	// running inversion count moves by the same two terms the Fenwick tree
	// tracks, but each term is read off one bisection — no tree, no
	// compression, and the window itself stays materialized. The trade is
	// the O(k) element shift per insert and delete; with k up to n that is
	// quadratic in the worst case but so cache-friendly that mid-size
	// windows stay fast.
	//
	// Equal values need care at both ends: removing uses the leftmost
	// matching position so exactly one copy leaves, inserting uses the
	// rightmost so the newcomer lands after its equals and only pairs with
	// strictly larger survivors.
