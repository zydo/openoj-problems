	// helps them (their reply options only shrink), so inside one letter
	// a player always answers with their largest remaining word there,
	// and a jump into the next letter is played at that letter's largest
	// word. After a player spends their largest word of a letter they
	// can never play in that letter again, so the fight in each letter
	// above the first is one reply long: enter with your max, opponent
	// answers with theirs or exits upward, entrant exits upward or
	// loses.

	// Sweep letters top-down with enter[c] = "the player who enters this
	// letter with their largest word wins", then resolve Bob's two
	// options at the forced opener a[0]: answer inside the letter or
	// jump to the next letter at once.
