        # 00, 25, 50, or 75 — or when nothing survives, since both the
        # empty result and a lone '0' equal 0. Pick positions i < j for
        # that closing pair: every digit before i may be retained free
        # of charge because it never moves the mod-25 outcome, so the
        # bill is the j - i - 1 digits wedged between the pair plus the
        # n - 1 - j digits after it, totaling n - i - 2 — smallest when
        # i sits as far right as possible. Taking each ending's
        # rightmost second-digit slot j and then the nearest matching
        # first digit strictly left of j already maximizes i: every
        # candidate first digit lies left of that slot or the pair is
        # impossible. Fallbacks: retaining one lone '0' costs n - 1,
        # and wiping all digits costs n. With at most 100 digits the
        # counts are tiny.
