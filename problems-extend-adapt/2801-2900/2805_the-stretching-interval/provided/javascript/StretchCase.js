// bundle-provided driver for 2805 the-stretching-interval. Assembled into
// every submission by the judge ahead of the submitted code; never
// editable in the editor. This file is the hidden implementation —
// solvers see only the public API documented in the statement.
//
// Judging runs on a deterministic virtual clock, so real time and real
// timers have no influence on what is judged. drive() swaps the global
// setTimeout/clearTimeout for virtual-clock equivalents, supplies its
// own recording fn (every actual execution appends the virtual execution
// time to the transcript), invokes the submission's stretchInterval(fn,
// delay, period) exactly once, schedules stretchCancel(id) at the
// case's cancelTimeMs through the same patched clock, and then drains
// every scheduled timer to completion — earliest deadline first, ties
// broken by scheduling order, which is exactly how Node drains its timer
// phase. The interval's first timer registers before the cancel timeout;
// ticks re-scheduled from inside earlier callbacks register later, so a
// re-scheduled tick landing exactly on cancelTimeMs loses that tie and is
// cleared unrecorded. The clock pins to each fired deadline itself, so
// rows record their own instant; verdict() returns the recorded times in
// execution order.
