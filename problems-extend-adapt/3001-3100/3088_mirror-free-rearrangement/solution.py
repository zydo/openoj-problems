class Solution:
    def smallestMirrorFree(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Swaps reach every permutation of s, so the answer is the
        # lexicographically smallest anti-palindrome rearrangement. Sorting
        # already gives the smallest possible left half, and the left half
        # of a sorted string never mirrors onto itself, so only the right
        # half needs repair: whenever a position matches its mirror, swap
        # in the next larger letter, tracked by a pointer that only moves
        # right. The pointer running off the end means some letter fills
        # more than half the string — no arrangement can separate it.
