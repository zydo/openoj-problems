// A length-2 substring of s shows up in reverse(s) exactly when its own

// adjacent pair xy into yx. One pass records each pair in a set and looks
// the current pair up flipped — a hit on yx means an earlier xy mirrors
// into it, and a later yx finds the xy recorded before it. A doubled
// letter is its own reversal, so xx matches the moment it appears.
