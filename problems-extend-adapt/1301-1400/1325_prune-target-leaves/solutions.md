# Solutions — Prune Target Leaves

## Two-phase stack, judged post-order

Whether a node survives depends on its children first: only after both
subtrees have been pruned can the node itself be judged — it dies exactly
when both pruned children are gone and its value equals the target. A
post-order traversal therefore prunes the whole cascade in one pass; the
deletion of a child can turn its parent into a target leaf, and the parent
is judged right after, so no repeated sweeps are needed.

The traversal is an explicit two-phase stack (push to expand, push again
to judge) rather than recursion — the tree may be a 3000-node chain, past
every language's default recursion budget. Each node is processed twice.

**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(h) stack space with h the tree height.
