# Solutions — Average-Clearing Windows

## Approach: Sliding window with an integer comparison

A window of size k qualifies when its average is at least the threshold —
multiplying both sides by k turns that into the exact integer test
`window_sum >= k * threshold`, so no fractional averages are ever formed.
The sum of the first k elements seeds the window; each step right adds the
entering element and removes the leaving one, an O(1) update, and the
qualifying windows are counted as they pass.

Every window is examined exactly once, in order of its start index.

**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) extra space.
