# Solutions — Rolling Seven-Day Take

## Self-join over the day axis

The window is defined on calendar days, not rows, so charges are first
collapsed to one row per day (`GROUP BY settled_on`), and each day
`d1` is joined against every daily total `d2` whose day lies in
`[d1 - 6 days, d1]` — SQLite's `DATE(d1.settled_on, '-6 day')`
performs the calendar arithmetic. `SUM(d2.charge)` then totals the
seven-day window and `ROUND(SUM(d2.charge) / 7.0, 2)` produces the
two-decimal average; the division by `7.0` (a real, not integer
division) keeps the fraction.

Only complete windows count: the first six days of the table have
fewer than seven distinct days behind them, so `HAVING COUNT(*) = 7`
drops them — exactly the statement's "current day + 6 days before"
reading, where the output starts on the seventh day. The final
`ORDER BY settled_on` meets the required ascending order.

With `D` distinct days the join pairs each day with at most 7 others,
so the work is `O(D)` window sums over the grouped table.

**Complexity:** `O(D · 7)` time, `O(D)` space, `D` = number of
distinct days.
