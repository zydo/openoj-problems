// Inverting `order` gives pos[v], and the BST built by inserting in
// that order is exactly the min-Cartesian tree of pos[1..n]: the root
// is the first-inserted value and every subtree spans a contiguous
// range of values. A monotonic stack over values 1..n (pos increasing
// bottom to top) then recovers every parent in O(n) — popping for v,
// the last value popped re-hangs as v's left child, since it is the
// later-inserted of the two value-neighbours v lands between, while a
// value popped earlier keeps the stack-below parent it was given when
// pushed. Depths fill in insertion order afterwards — a parent is
// always inserted before its children — so two flat sweeps, no
// recursion, cope with the 10^5-deep chains the constraints allow.
