// Positive divisors pair off (d, n/d), so exactly three divisors forces
// n = x*x and a divisor list of just 1, x, x^2 -- which holds precisely
// when x is prime (a composite root x = a*b would add a*b as a fourth
// divisor). Since n <= 10^4, the root x <= 100, so trial division up to
// sqrt(x) costs at most a dozen checks.
