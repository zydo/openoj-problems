// With values capped at 100, a value is either present in a range or
// not, and 100 prefix-count rows decide that in O(1): row v holds the
// occurrence count of v over every prefix of nums, so v appears in
// nums[l..r] exactly when its count rises between l and r+1. A query
// then walks the value axis 1..100, collects the values whose counts
// rise, and takes the smallest gap between consecutive ones — present
// values arrive in increasing order, and the minimum |a[i] - a[j]| over
// a set always sits between value-adjacent elements. Fewer than two
// rising rows means every element in the range matches, so the answer
// is -1; with two or more the gap is at most 99, which is what makes
// the untouched sentinel honest. The flat 100 x (n+1) int32 slice is
// ~40 MB — inside the memory budget — and every count fits 32-bit by
// construction.
