# Solutions — Longest Even-Handed Window After One Swap

Encode `1` as `+1` and `0` as `-1`. A window is either already
even-handed, or one swap across its boundary must change its balance by
exactly two.

## Prefix balances with sliding earliest positions

A usable window therefore has balance `0`, balance `+2` with a zero
available outside it, or balance `-2` with a one available outside it.
For a `+2` window of length `L`, the outside-zero condition is
equivalent to `L <= 2 * totalZeros`; symmetrically, a `-2` window must
satisfy `L <= 2 * totalOnes`.

For each of these three target balances, scan the prefix sums while a
hash map stores queues of prefix positions within the applicable
maximum length. The oldest position with the required prefix balance
gives the longest candidate ending at the current index. Each position
enters and leaves a queue once.

**Complexity:** `O(n)` time, `O(n)` space.
