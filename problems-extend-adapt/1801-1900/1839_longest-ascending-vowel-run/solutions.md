# Solutions — Longest Ascending Vowel Run

An ascending vowel run is a stretch of vowels that never steps backwards
in the order `a < e < i < o < u` and, at the end, contains all five
letters. Because the alphabet is only the five vowels and they must
appear in non-decreasing order, an ascending vowel run is exactly a
maximal non-decreasing run of vowels that happens to cover all five.

## Scan maximal non-decreasing runs

Walk the string once. Each run starts at an `'a'` (any other starting
letter cannot begin a run, since `'a'` must come first) and
extends while each next character is `>=` its predecessor — comparing the
characters directly works because the vowel set is in alphabetical order.
When the run ends, check whether it collected all five vowels (a 5-bit
mask with one bit per vowel makes that a single comparison against `31`)
and update the answer with its length. The next run begins where this one
ended, so every character is visited a constant number of times.

Examples 1 and 3 show the winning outcome — `"aaaeiiooouuu"` is one full
run of length 12, `"aaaeeeiiiiooouuu"` of length 15 — while example 2's
run `"aeeeiiiiooo"` stops before `u` and scores nothing. The scan is
linear — critical at the `5 * 10⁵`
length ceiling — and needs only constant extra state: the current run's
mask and two indices.

**Complexity:** `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space.
