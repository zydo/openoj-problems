# Solutions — Repeating Until Cancelled

A repeating schedule that can be stopped needs one immediate call, one
repeating timer, and a closure that retains the timer handle. The
deterministic virtual-clock driver replays those same operations without
relying on wall-clock timing.

## Immediate Call and One Repeating Timer

Call `fn(...args)` before scheduling anything so the first transcript row
is recorded at time zero. Then schedule the same call with `setInterval`
every `t` milliseconds. Both calls use the captured `args`, so every
execution receives the original arguments while state held inside `fn`
can still evolve from one call to the next.

Store the interval handle and return a closure that passes it to
`clearInterval`. When cancellation runs, clearing that single handle
prevents all later repeats; clearing it after a tick does not alter calls
that already completed. If `r` executions occur and `m = args.length`,
applying the arguments accounts for the work of each invocation while
timer bookkeeping stays constant-sized.

**Complexity:** `O(r * m)` time across `r` calls with `m` arguments, `O(1)`
extra space beyond the supplied arguments and timer runtime.
