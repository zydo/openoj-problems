# Solutions — Rightmost Match In A Sorted Array

## Binary Search for the Rightmost Occurrence

The enhancement installs `rightmostMatch` on `Array.prototype` as a
hi-converging binary search. Two pointers bracket the answer with the
invariant that everything left of `lo` is `<= target` and everything from
`hi` onward is `> target`. Each step probes the middle: a probe at or
below the target discards the whole left side (`lo = mid + 1`), anything
greater shrinks the right edge to it (`hi = mid`). The probed side is
always safe to drop because the array is sorted, so each comparison
halves the range.

When the pointers meet, `lo` is the first index past the target's run —
the position just right of every occurrence — so the last occurrence is
`lo - 1`, reported only if `nums[lo - 1]` really equals the target and
the `-1` sentinel otherwise. That single final equality check settles
every edge without special cases: a target smaller than all elements
leaves `lo` at 0, one larger than all leaves the last-checked element
unequal, and one falling in a gap between elements stops `lo` on the
first greater value — each resolves to -1, while a genuine hit at index
0 still reports 0 because equality, not truthiness, decides.

**Complexity:** `O(log n)` time, `O(1)` space.
