// Every function is called immediately, so all promises run in parallel;
// each one gets both a fulfillment and a rejection handler attached up
// front, which is what keeps every rejection individually caught (and the
// aggregate itself always fulfilled). Results are written at their own
// index, so settlement order can never shuffle them, and the pending
// counter resolves the aggregate exactly when the last promise settles —
// an empty input short-circuits to [] before anything is awaited.
