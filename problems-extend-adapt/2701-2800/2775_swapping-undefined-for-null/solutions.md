# Solutions — Swapping Undefined For Null

## Explicit-Stack Clone and Sweep

Walk the value with an explicit stack instead of recursion: the
constraints admit a serialized form of up to 10⁵ characters, and a chain
like `[[[[…]]]]` spends only two characters per level, so a legal input
can nest tens of thousands deep — far past what call-stack recursion
survives. First deep-copy the input with an explicit-stack walk of its
own (every container becomes a fresh array or plain object, scalars
copied as-is), then sweep the copy container by container: arrays
position by position, objects over their own enumerable keys. A slot
holding `undefined` is overwritten with `null`; any other container is
pushed for the same treatment; every other value — including
pre-existing nulls — passes through untouched.

Two details carry the weight. Array-ness is tested before the generic
object branch, because arrays are objects too and would otherwise be
swept by key iteration with the wrong shape of work; and own-key
iteration (`Object.keys`) is sufficient because inputs are
JSON.parse-shaped: plain containers whose slots are all own data
properties, with no inherited or symbolic keys to filter out. Each value
is visited once by the copy walk and once by the sweep, and the copy
doubles as the returned structure, so the footprint is one new object
graph the size of the input.

**Complexity:** `O(n)` time, `O(n)` space, where `n` is the number of
values and containers in obj.
