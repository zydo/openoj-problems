        # onto the end, so every rotation of s is s[k:] + s[:k]. Doubling s
        # spells all n of them out at once: the length-n windows of s+s are
        # exactly the rotations, so goal matches one exactly when it occurs
        # inside s+s. The length check must come first: a shorter goal can
        # occur inside s+s without being a rotation.
