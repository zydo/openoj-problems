// Reachability folds into three facts about the final position. X moves
// first and play strictly alternates, so the counts must satisfy
// x == o or x == o + 1. The game stops at the first completed line, so
// at most one player holds a winning row, column, or diagonal — and the
// winner's decisive placement pins the tally exactly: X's winning move
// leaves x == o + 1, O's leaves x == o. A board passing all three gates
// was played; any other board is unreachable.
