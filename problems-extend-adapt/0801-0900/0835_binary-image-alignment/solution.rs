// A translation slides every 1 of one image by one shared vector, so a 1
// at (i1, j1) in img1 sits on a 1 at (i2, j2) in img2 exactly under the
// shift that carries (i2, j2) onto (i1, j1) — the delta between the two
// cells. Counting over all pairs of 1-cells how often each delta occurs
// scores every shift at once, and the largest count is the largest
// overlap. Delta components lie in [-29, 29], so the packed key
// dr*100 + dc is injective.
