        # One iterative pass — an explicit stack, never recursion, since
        # a skewed tree runs 10^4 nodes deep — records each value's depth
        # and parent. Values are unique, so a value keys both maps. The
        # answer then folds pairwise over the query values: hold the
        # running LCA candidate, and for each further value lift the
        # deeper of the two to the other's depth, then walk both up in
        # lockstep until they meet. The LCA is associative — the LCA of
        # the whole list is the LCA of the running candidate and each new
        # value — so the fold lands on the shared ancestor, and a
        # one-value query returns that value untouched. The root rides
        # with parent None; no climb ever passes the LCA, which is at
        # the latest the root, so the None is never dereferenced.
