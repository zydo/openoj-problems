# Solutions — Busiest Pair Of Hubs

## Degree counting with an adjacency-set adjustment

Two cities' joint tally is almost just the sum of their degrees — the
only wrinkle is that a road directly connecting the two cities gets
double-counted by that sum and must be subtracted back out. So the
approach is two passes: first tally `degree[city]` by scanning `roads`
once, incrementing both endpoints; then, separately, record every road
in a hash set (as a canonical pair, e.g. the smaller city first) so "are
these two cities directly connected" is an `O(1)` lookup.

With both structures built, every pair of distinct cities `(i, j)` is
tried: its tally is `degree[i] + degree[j]`, minus one if `(i, j)` is
present in the adjacency set. The maximum over all `O(n^2)` pairs is
the answer. Because `n` is at most 100, enumerating every pair
directly is cheap, and the hash-set membership test keeps each pair's
work constant instead of rescanning `roads`.

**Complexity:** `O(n^2 + roads.length)` time, `O(n + roads.length)`
space.
